- Connection request was pending, not connected. Removed from tracker, HubSpot status reverted to "Pending."
- Draft ready: CFO-to-CEO rapport-first 4-msg sequence. Add back when he accepts.

## Podcast
- Matt Halloran (Zocks, Chief Evangelist) — connection request sent. TEDx speaker, author, co-founded ProudMouth (podcast company). Dream podcast guest. Second entry point into Zocks alongside Drew.

## Trackers Created

- [Veza Talks Podcast Guest Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XVh2TY4oK8JDmEHpfkYOOkOzHTOzij2nuvNZoBKFRg8/edit)

## Next Actions (by date)
- **Feb 24**: Adam Frank — Msg 2 (tech audit offer) if no reply
- **Feb 26**: Drew DiMarino — Msg 2 (AEO ask + fintech signal) if no reply
- **Feb 28**: Kelly Harvey, Steele Billings, Alex (if call not booked), Brianne (closed), Daniel Levy, James Wilson — Msg 2 due for those still waiting

## Key Learnings
- Rapport-first > generic ask (Alex converted, Brianne bounced)
- Yaya prefers shorter, simpler messages — cut anything performative
- For priority leads, layer reveals across messages (genuine → relevant → specific → credible)
- Fintech portfolio (Bench, Earned, Flinks, Mizuho) = save for credibility bomb later in sequence
- Veza Talks podcast = parallel ABM channel for relationship building
