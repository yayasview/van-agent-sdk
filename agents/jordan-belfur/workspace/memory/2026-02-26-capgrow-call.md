# 2026-02-26 — CapGrow Partners Proposal Review Call

## What Happened

Proposal review call with Sydney Gutierrez. Walked her through the full $66,700 proposal. Call went well — no price resistance, strong engagement on WAIO, clear next steps established.

## Key Takeaways

### Positive Signals
- **No price pushback** — Sydney said "great" when the $66,700 number landed
- **WAIO interest** — Called AI discoverability "really interesting" and "an ongoing concern." Strongest add-on signal.
- **Training questions** — Asked detailed questions about the 3-session breakdown. This matters to her.
- **Maintenance vs support reframe landed** — She came in thinking $10-12K/yr maintenance. Left understanding Webflow = zero maintenance, support = active building. Said "that helps me quite a bit."
- **Phased approach addressed her #1 concern** — Review cycles / managing Matt internally. Figma reviewable link + gated approvals = exactly what she needed.

### Risk Signals
- **Comparing vendors** — "A handful of more meetings" before presenting to team
- **Loose timeline** — Decision "within the next month," go-live end Q2 / beginning Q3
- **Budget mental model is small** — $10-12K/yr maintenance expectation. Support retainer ($5-8K/mo) will be a harder post-launch conversation.
- **Rate discrepancy** — Said $150/hr for additional revision hours on call. Proposal blended rate is $175/hr. Must reconcile before SOW.
- **"Natalia" at sign-off** — Possible transcription error, possible vendor confusion. Stay memorable.
- **Content pre-work dependency** — Sydney acknowledged team needs to review copy before design phase starts. Potential delay between signing and kickoff.

### Intel Gathered
- **SEO audit: no interest** — "We're pretty solid" and organic search isn't big in their industry
- **Content approach** — Using existing copy as base, needs modernization. Team needs to look at it before project starts.
- **Designer preference** — Startup/nonprofit background, human-centric design. "The crossover in the sentiment is pretty similar for the industry."
- **Revision expectations** — 2-3+ rounds with internal stakeholders. Offered 3rd round baked in or ad hoc at stated $150/hr.
- **Hosting** — Confirmed $50-100/mo Webflow hosting is fine. She asked for a breakdown to share.
- **Support plans** — Shared range ($3.5-15K/mo, most clients $5-8K). She noted this is "considerably higher" than budgeted.

## Follow-Up Plan (by ~Mar 4)
1. Send follow-up email with call recap + Webflow hosting breakdown
2. Send 3-4 portfolio examples matching startup/nonprofit/human-centric aesthetic
3. Tease WAIO — one-pager or example for behavioral health space
4. Do NOT send SOW — premature until verbal commit

## HubSpot Updated
- Stage: Proposal Call Booked → Proposal Review & Negotiations
- Amount: $60,000 → $66,700
- Close date: set to 2026-03-31
- Call notes appended to description

## Open Item
- ~~**Reconcile the $150/hr vs $175/hr**~~ — RESOLVED. $175/hr doesn't appear anywhere in the proposal (only flat workstream totals). $150/hr is the only rate Sydney has heard. Honor $150 in SOW for revision hours. Internal scoping stays at $175.
