Hi Jordan, can you give me some background on the Hiya account?
assistant: On it — let me pull what we have.
assistant: Here's the Hiya rundown, Yaya 👇

**🏢 Hiya — Tier 1 Account Brief**

**What they do:** AI-powered Voice Intelligence Platform. They protect and enhance voice calls for enterprises, carriers, and OEMs — think branded calling, spam/fraud protection, caller reputation scoring. 223 employees, B2B SaaS, solid momentum.

**Why they're Tier 1:**
- **95/100 VAN fit score** — one of our highest
- Already on **Webflow** (24 users, 3 projects) — no platform debate needed
- **4.5M monthly visitors** with a painful **58/100 performance score** — that's leaving conversions on the table at serious scale
- **Active company momentum:** new products, expanding globally, partnered with Deutsche Telekom, Samsung, O2, Telenor — their web presence needs to keep pace

**AEO Score:** 59/100 — *High Risk* classification. LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) are all missing key messaging about their target audience, products, and differentiators. Classic AI discoverability gap.

**👥 Buying Committee**

| Person | Role | Angle |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Stephanie Boulanger** | Principal PMM | 🔥 **Recommended entry point** — 58 days in role, First 90 Days window |
| **Natalie Rohde** | Director of Product Marketing | First 6 months, building her playbook |
| **Julianne Maila** | Director of Product Marketing | Tenured — may be feeling platform friction |
| **Anthony Lanham** | CRO | Economic buyer — challenge status quo angle |
| **Jonathan Nelson** | Director of Product Mgmt | Potential blocker — PM owns eng resources marketing needs |

---

**🎯 Why Now**

Stephanie Boulanger is **58 days into her role** — that window closes fast. She's proving herself, looking for quick wins, evaluating the inherited stack. That's our moment. Lead with the AI brand report (59/100 is a compelling hook), offer value, get her in a teaching event.

**Next move:** Engage Stephanie on LinkedIn → multi-thread to Anthony Lanham on email once champion conversation is established.

Want me to draft outreach for Stephanie?

Could you add this to your config: messages.ackReaction: ":eyes:" If I understand correctly, it should allow you to react with the emoji for tasks that take longer. That lets me know you're working on it.
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] On it!
assistant: Done, Yaya. 👀 reaction is live — from now on, when I'm working on something that takes a bit, you'll see the eyes emoji so you know I'm on it. Appreciate the QoL upgrade.

assistant: Here's the Foxglove contact lineup, Yaya:

**👥 Foxglove — Key Contacts**

| Name | Role | Tenure | Priority |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Sandeep Kini** | Head of Growth | 58 days in role 🔥 | **#1 — Economic buyer, First 90 Days** |
| **Dana Bacharach** | Go To Market Growth | 88 days in role | Strong secondary — also new, GTM-focused |
| **Milin Mehta** | Head of Communications | 58 days in role | Secondary — comms/brand angle |
| **Adrian Macneil** | Co-Founder & CEO | Since founding (2021) | Awareness play, not entry point |

---

**Key context:**

- **Sandeep is the move.** He's Head of Growth, 58 days in role, and already the economic buyer in our data. First 90 Days window = wide open for new partnerships. Lead with the AI brand report angle.
- **Dana Bacharach** is interesting — GTM Growth role, also new. Could be a champion if Sandeep doesn't bite.
- **Foxglove just closed a $40M Series B** (November 2025, led by Bessemer) — budget is fresh and they're in deploy mode. The timing is legit.
- They're on Webflow (2 projects, 10 users) and their site actually performs well (99/100 score) — so the angle here is less about performance and more about **AEO/AI discoverability** as they scale post-funding.

Recommended play: Hit Sandeep on LinkedIn with the AI brand report. The fresh capital + new role = perfect storm. Want me to draft the outreach?
