# Session Log: 2026-02-25 — Dimer Health RFP Response

## What Happened

Dimer Health deal fundamentally expanded. What was a stalled $10K retainer became a formal RFP for a full-service marketing & growth partner. Series A raised, scope spans 5 pillars (positioning, GTM, website, marketing execution, sales enablement).

## Work Completed

1. **Reviewed RFP** — 3-page "Marketing & Growth Partner Brief" from Arielle Newcombe. Deadline Feb 27.
2. **Reviewed Clay enrichment** — 44 employees, $14M Series A (Oct 2024), tech stack (Webflow + Wix), Lighthouse scores (Performance 56, SEO 100, Accessibility 87), 425 monthly visits, recent partnerships + awards.
3. **Reviewed AEO report** — Overall 62.96/100 (HIGH RISK). ChatGPT (55.6) confuses them with UV disinfection company. Gemini (61.1) hallucinated fake company + fake testimonials. Perplexity (72.2) only accurate platform.
4. **Wrote comprehensive deal brief** — `knowledge/deals/dimer-health-54735682834/deal-brief.md` — includes RFP breakdown, AEO analysis, Clay data, company intel, VAN service mapping, deal strategy, competitive assessment.
5. **Drafted presentation outline** — `proposals/dimer-health/presentation-outline-v1.md` — 16-slide deck based on Collin's Lessen.com presentation template. Key innovation: AEO data as the unique differentiator slide.

## Key Decisions

- **Selling as VAN** (confirmed by Yaya)
- **Pricing model:** Monthly billing. Project (Months 1-4) → Retainer (Month 5+). Same monthly budget, different deliverables.
- **Presentation format** instead of document-based proposal (different from CapGrow/Sofar approach)
- **AEO is the lead weapon** — no other agency will have this data

## Still Needed (for tomorrow morning)

- [ ] Healthcare case studies from Yaya
- [ ] Team structure (names, roles, photos)
- [ ] Monthly budget range
- [ ] Latest discovery call notes (beyond Jan 22)
- [ ] Build actual presentation (Google Slides or generate from outline)
