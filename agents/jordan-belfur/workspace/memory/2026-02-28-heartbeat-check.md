## Conversation Summary

user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
Current time: Friday, February 27th, 2026 — 5:33 AM (UTC)
assistant: The `HEARTBEAT.md` file indicates that 5:33 AM UTC is 1:33 AM ET, which falls within the quiet hours (23:00-08:00 ET). During quiet hours, the instruction is to reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` unless there is something urgent. Since there are no urgent alerts identified, and no pipeline movement can be assessed without further steps, the appropriate response is `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

Current time: Friday, February 27th, 2026 — 1:22 PM (UTC)
assistant: The `memory/2026-02-27.md` file does not exist, meaning there are no new daily notes or extracted facts from today.

The `MEMORY.md` file shows the following "Pipeline State":
- All accounts (EventsAir, Foxglove, Gloo, Hiya, Imagen, Pearl, Rootly, Siro, Zocks) have their "Last Touch" date as "2026-02-18".
- Today's date is Friday, February 27th, 2026.
- This means all accounts listed have not been touched in 9 days (27 - 18 = 9).

The `HEARTBEAT.md` instruction states: "**Pipeline pulse** — scan for accounts that haven't been touched in 2+ weeks".
Since the current date is February 27th, 2026, and the "Last Touch" date for all accounts is February 18th, 2026, none of the accounts have been untouched for *2+ weeks* (which would be February 13th, 2026, or earlier). They have only been untouched for 9 days.

Therefore, based on the current information and the instructions in `HEARTBEAT.md`, there are no accounts that require immediate attention for being untouched for 2+ weeks.
Also, there were no new daily notes to process, and no new conversations provided to extract facts from.

Thus, nothing needs attention.HEARTBEAT_OK

Current time: Friday, February 27th, 2026 — 5:22 PM (UTC)
assistant: The `memory/2026-02-27.md` file does not exist, indicating no new daily notes have been created since the last check.

Looking at `MEMORY.md`, the "Last Touch" date for all accounts in the "Pipeline State" table is "2026-02-18".
Today's date is Friday, February 27th, 2026.
This means all accounts have not been touched for 9 days (27 - 18 = 9).

The `HEARTBEAT.md` instruction for the "Pipeline pulse" states: "scan for accounts that haven't been touched in 2+ weeks".
Two weeks would be 14 days. Since 9 days is less than 14 days, none of the accounts meet the criteria of being untouched for "2+ weeks".

Additionally, there are no recent conversations provided to extract durable facts from, and no indications of deals moving.

Therefore, according to the `HEARTBEAT.md` instructions, nothing requires immediate attention.

assistant: The `memory/2026-02-27.md` file does not exist, meaning there are no new daily notes or extracted facts from today.

According to `MEMORY.md`, the "Last Touch" date for all accounts in the "Pipeline State" table is "2026-02-18".
The current time is Friday, February 27th, 2026, 9:22 PM UTC, which is 5:22 PM ET. This is outside of the "Quiet Hours" (23:00-08:00 ET).

The `HEARTBEAT.md` instruction for the "Pipeline pulse" states: "scan for accounts that haven't been touched in 2+ weeks".
Two weeks from February 18th, 2026, would be March 4th, 2026. The current date is February 27th, 2026. Therefore, no accounts have been untouched for 2+ weeks (14 days).

As there are no new daily notes to process, no conversations to extract facts from, and no accounts that meet the "untouched for 2+ weeks" criterion, nothing requires immediate attention based on the `HEARTBEAT.md` instructions.
