Hi Daniel,

Excited to officially kick things off with you. The signed agreement is attached for your records.

I'm handing things over to our project team now — you'll be hearing from **David Georgievski**, your dedicated Group Account Director, within the next 24 hours to get your kickoff scheduled.

In the meantime, here are a couple of things that will help us hit the ground running:

1. **Brand & design assets** — logos, fonts, brand guidelines, or any style references you'd like us to work from
2. **Platform access** — current website/CMS credentials, Google Analytics, HubSpot access, Twilio chat integration code, and Smartling translation credentials
3. **Key stakeholders** — if there's anyone else on your team who should be included in project communications, let us know and we'll loop them in

We'll cover everything in detail during kickoff, but getting a head start on the above means we can move faster from day one.

Welcome to Shadow Digital — looking forward to building something great together.

Best,
Yaya
