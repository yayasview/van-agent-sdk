## Meeting History

### Discovery Call — Feb 12, 2026
**Attendees:** Yaya, Rosy, Michelle

- Website is a "lasagna" — layers of additions without strategy, held together with duct tape
- Nobody has ever owned the website; marketing team has been cobbling things together
- Both Rosy and Michelle are new, hired specifically to fix this
- No Webflow expertise on team — need training, components, templates
- Two distinct audiences: digitally native (conversion-focused) + traditional (brochure for sales outreach)
- Want motion-heavy, ocean-inspired design with parallax and animations
- Clean-slate rebuild is the likely path

### Proposal Walkthrough — Feb 17, 2026
**Attendees:** Yaya, Rosy, Maggie

- Presented two options:
  - **Dev-only:** $68,960 / 12 weeks / 384 hrs at $178 blended
  - **Full service (design + dev):** $102,360 / 18 weeks / 568 hrs
- **Client leaning dev-only** (budget constraints)
- Rosy has an updated sitemap (solutions-based restructure) — will share for re-scoping
- NOT moving to Webflow Enterprise — staying on Business plan
- Timeline well received — Rosy expected 4-5 months, we quoted 3 months for dev-only
- Sprint model: 2-week batches, designs delivered in tandem (not all upfront)
- Go-to-market: full rebuild then single relaunch (no phased releases)
- Figma handoff: desktop-only, no auto-layout, one template per content type
- Current sitemap: ~50 pages across core, Spotter, Wayfinder, CMS pages
- Business plan limits fine — well under 100 static pages / 100 collections

---

## Current State & Tech Stack

- **Platform:** Webflow (Business plan, not Enterprise)
- **Problem:** No architecture, no component system, no templates — every page built from scratch. Changes in one place break things elsewhere. Team afraid to touch it.
- **Structure:** ~50 pages across core, Spotter product, Wayfinder product, CMS pages (blog, events, reports)
- **Design:** Needs solutions-based IA restructure (from product-focused to solutions-focused)

---

## What They Need

1. Clean-slate Webflow rebuild
2. Dual-audience strategy (digital-native conversion + traditional brochure)
3. Motion-heavy, ocean-inspired design (parallax, GSAP/native animations)
4. Solutions-based information architecture
5. Training and enablement (no Webflow expertise on team)
6. Component library + templates for self-sufficiency
7. One template per content type (blog, events, reports)

---

## Deal Status & Risks

- **Blocker:** Waiting on Rosy's updated sitemap to finalize proposals
- **Dead zone:** Rosy OOO until March 10
- **Platform decision pending:** Webflow vs. WordPress comparison still open
- **Budget modest:** $70K — below typical $200K+ enterprise engagement
- **No economic buyer identified:** Talking to marketing ops + designer. Who signs the check?
- **Referral angle:** Rick Razzano (Webflow AE) could influence platform decision

### Next Actions
1. Confirm whether Rosy sent updated sitemap before OOO
2. March 10: Check-in when she returns
3. Identify the economic buyer
4. Prepare both proposal options now so they're ready to send
