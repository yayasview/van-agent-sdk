## 1. The Opportunity

Sofar Ocean has built something extraordinary — the world's largest real-time ocean sensor network, powering decisions across maritime shipping, climate science, defense, and coastal resilience. Spotter buoys floating in every ocean. Wayfinder routing ships around weather. Forecasting models that outperform legacy providers. The technology speaks for itself.

The website doesn't.

What you have today is what your team calls a "lasagna" — layers of additions built over years without a unifying architecture, component system, or content strategy. Every page was built from scratch. Changes in one section break things in another. The marketing team is afraid to touch it. And when a prospect lands on sofarocean.com after a conference conversation or a Wayfinder demo, they're met with a site that doesn't reflect the sophistication of the product behind it.

This matters more now than it did a year ago. Sofar's audience has split into two distinct segments — digitally native buyers who expect a modern, conversion-driven experience, and traditional maritime operators who need a clear, credible overview they can share with their fleet management teams. The current site serves neither well. There's no solutions-based navigation, no persona-specific entry points, and no way for Rosy or Michelle to create targeted content without rebuilding pages from scratch.

Meanwhile, the team has grown. Rosy, Michelle, and Maggie are the first dedicated marketing and design hires focused on the website — but they've inherited a platform with no documentation, no component library, and no templates. The tools don't match the talent.

The opportunity: a clean-slate rebuild that gives Sofar a site architecture worthy of the technology it represents — solutions-based navigation, motion-heavy design that evokes the ocean, a component library the team can actually use, and a CMS structure that scales with 200+ pieces of existing content and everything that comes next.

---

## 2. Expected Outcomes

**Solutions-based navigation that sells** — Visitors will find what they need through the lens of what Sofar solves (voyage intelligence, ocean sensing, weather forecasting, defense) — not through a product catalog. Each solution area will have its own entry point, use cases, and conversion path.

**Two audiences, one site** — Digitally native buyers get the interactive, conversion-optimized experience they expect. Traditional maritime operators get the clean, authoritative overview they need to share internally. Both audiences self-select within seconds of landing.

**A site that moves like the ocean** — Parallax scrolling, native Webflow animations, and motion design throughout — not as decoration, but as a storytelling device that reinforces Sofar's identity. The site will feel alive in a way that matches the real-time data flowing through your sensor network.

**Marketing team independence** — Rosy, Michelle, and Maggie will be able to create, edit, and launch pages using a documented component library and pre-built templates — without rebuilding from scratch every time. What currently requires starting from zero will be drag-and-drop.

**A scalable content engine** — 200+ blog posts, research papers, case studies, and event listings migrated into a structured CMS with proper taxonomy, filtering, and templates. New content types can be added without developer involvement.

**Clean architecture, zero tech debt** — Every component named, documented, and reusable. No more "lasagna" — a system where changes in one place don't break things elsewhere. The team won't be afraid to touch the site anymore.

**SEO foundation from day one** — Technical SEO, on-page optimization, redirect mapping, and schema markup implemented during the build — not bolted on afterward. The organic equity you've built over years gets preserved and strengthened.

## 3. Our Approach

We work in sprint-based cycles — each sprint delivers tangible progress, each major phase requires your sign-off before we move forward. Nothing gets built that your team hasn't reviewed, and nothing gets approved that doesn't map back to your business goals.

**Design handoff model (Dev Only):** Maggie delivers Figma designs sprint-by-sprint, and our team translates them into production Webflow — with a design consultant embedded in the first two weeks to ensure every design decision is Webflow-feasible before a single pixel gets built. This keeps the creative vision in-house while our team handles the technical execution.

**Full service model:** We handle everything — discovery, information architecture, UX wireframes, UI design, motion direction, and development. Your team reviews at structured gates throughout, and Maggie stays involved as a design collaborator rather than the sole design owner.

**Regardless of path, every engagement includes:**

**Phase 1 — Foundation** — We align on the solutions-based sitemap, lock in the component architecture, and run an SEO audit so we're building on solid ground. In the dev-only path, this is where our design consultant reviews Maggie's approach and flags anything that won't translate cleanly to Webflow.

**Phase 2 — Build** — Core pages come to life in a staging environment. The component library gets built alongside the pages, so your team has reusable building blocks from day one. Motion and interaction design are woven into the build — not added as an afterthought.

**Phase 3 — Content & Migration** — 200+ pieces of content migrated to the new CMS structure with proper taxonomy, filtering, and templates. Blog posts, research papers, case studies, and event listings all get structured homes. Redirect mapping ensures nothing gets lost.

**Phase 4 — Launch & Enable** — Full QA across browsers and devices, SEO validation, and then a comprehensive handoff — documentation, component walkthrough, and hands-on training so the team is self-sufficient from day one.

We'll need your team engaged at key review points — typically once per sprint. Between reviews, we execute. You don't need to manage us.

## 6. Why Shadow Digital

**Motion-forward Webflow is what we do** — We've built 50+ enterprise sites on Webflow with native animations, parallax, and interaction design baked in from the start — not bolted on afterward. The ocean-inspired motion Sofar wants isn't a stretch for us — it's our standard.

**We've rebuilt "lasagna" sites before** — Companies that have layered additions for years without architecture are our sweet spot. We don't just redesign — we create a system: named components, documented patterns, and clean class structures so the next person who touches the site understands exactly what they're working with.

**Enablement-first, not dependency-first** — Your team is building Webflow expertise from scratch. Every engagement ends with documentation, training, and a component library designed for independence. We don't create dependency — we build capability. Six months post-launch, your team should be shipping pages without thinking about us.

**We've handled complex content migrations at scale** — TSIA: 200+ pages migrated in 6 weeks with 112% mobile speed improvement and zero SEO loss. Bench: 1,000+ content pieces migrated, marketing team creating 450 new pages within 6 months. Your 200+ blog posts, research papers, and case studies are well within our operating range.

**Sprint-based delivery with real accountability** — You'll see progress every two weeks in a staging environment. Not mockups, not wireframes — real pages you can click through. If something's off, we catch it in Week 3, not Week 12.

## 7. Select Case Studies

**Bench** — *Fintech | WordPress → Webflow Migration*
Bench came to us with 1,000+ content pieces trapped in a legacy CMS that their marketing team couldn't manage. We rebuilt their content architecture in Webflow and gave their team full publishing independence. Within 6 months: 450 new pages created by the marketing team alone, organic keywords grew from 2,000 to 4,900, and page creation capacity tripled. The same outcome we're designing for Rosy, Michelle, and Maggie.

**TSIA** — *Technology Services | Enterprise Webflow Migration*
TSIA needed 200+ pages migrated to Webflow without losing search equity — a scale nearly identical to Sofar's content library. We completed the full migration in 6 weeks, improved mobile page speed by 112%, and preserved their entire SEO footprint. Their team called it "an outstanding performance — delivered on time, on budget, and beyond expectations."

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Review both options** with your team
2. **Alignment call** — We'll walk through the proposal, answer questions, and help you decide between dev-only and full service
3. **SOW delivery** — Detailed Statement of Work based on the option you select
4. **Sign & kick off** — Lock in the engagement and schedule kickoff for the week of March 3

Sofar's website is the front door for every prospect who's seen a Spotter demo, attended a webinar, or met your team at a conference. Right now, the site behind that front door doesn't match the product behind it. The team is in place. The sitemap is ready. The only thing missing is the build partner.

We're ready to start when you are. Yannick is available at yaya@vezadigital.com to discuss anything before the alignment call.

*Post-launch, we also offer ongoing support retainers for continued optimization, content updates, and campaign support — happy to discuss once the site is live.*
