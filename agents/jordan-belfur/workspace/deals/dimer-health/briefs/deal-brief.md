## Deal Evolution

This deal has fundamentally changed. What started as a $10K/month retainer for website support has expanded into a full-service strategic marketing partnership RFP.

**Before (Jan 2026):** Arielle, a solo Head of Marketing, needed help refreshing the Webflow site — new pages, SEO, CMS training. We proposed Shadow Digital Pro+ tiers (Base $3.5K / Growth $5K / Ascend $8K). She was evaluating agencies. Deal stalled after Jan 27.

**Now (Feb 2026):** Dimer **closed their Series A** (week of Feb 20) and is entering their "next phase of growth." They've issued a formal RFP seeking a strategic marketing & growth partner — not a production vendor. The scope spans positioning, GTM strategy, website, marketing execution, and sales enablement. This is a VAN-level engagement across multiple service pillars.

**Pricing model (per Yaya):** Bill monthly. Start with a one-time project phase (website + positioning + foundational assets), then transition directly into an ongoing retainer with the same monthly budget but different deliverables (execution, optimization, content, enablement).

## Meeting History

### Discovery Call — Jan 22, 2026 (21 min)
**Attendees:** Yaya, Arielle Newcombe

- Website refresh and expansion needed — preserve existing UI/brand, add new pages (How It Works, partner info), build templates for educational content
- Content revisions for SEO and GEO optimization
- Goal: boost conversions — increase patient sign-ups and partner leads
- Website currently used as validation tool, not lead gen engine
- Future paid media plans: geotargeted ads near hospitals, LinkedIn to health system decision-makers
- Arielle is a department of one
- Current agency provides limited training, no strategic support
- Site already on Webflow with limited CMS usage
- Pain: site is underdeveloped — functions as validation tool, lacks educational content and structure to drive leads

### Quick Touchpoint — Jan 27, 2026 (3 min)
**Attendees:** Yaya, Arielle

- No update — pending internal discussions
- Arielle acknowledged proposal tiers (Base $3,500, Growth $5,000, Ascend $8,000)
- Requested proposal doc be sent
- Decision timeline: one week (that was 4 weeks ago)
- She was evaluating multiple agencies

### RFP Received — Feb 25, 2026
- Formal "Marketing & Growth Partner Brief" received
- Deadline: February 27, 2026
- Scope massively expanded from original website retainer
- Yaya has already positioned VAN as the responding entity (not Shadow Digital)
- Yaya had a discovery call with them (details pending — need to capture notes)

### Proposal Review Call — Feb 27, 2026 (30 min)
**Attendees:** Yaya, Arielle Newcombe
**Full notes:** `notes/2026-02-27-proposal-review-call.md`

Key outcomes:
- **Series A confirmed closed last week.** Oct 2024 was seed (Crunchbase wrong). Series A driving the expanded scope.
- **New product in development** — beta in ~2 months. Shift from clinic-forward to product-forward. Already talking to CMOs.
- **10x growth target in 2 years.** Current ARR ~$1.7M, near-term ~$2-3M by EOY.
- **Series A announcement targeting end of March** — Arielle piecemealing vendors to prep, wants agency selected + running by then.
- **Website:** Staying on Webflow. Not a rebrand. Wants "glow up" — clean, sophisticated, tech-forward + human. Two-sided experience (patients + partners). Has homepage content drafted + Figma mockup to share.
- **Priorities:** 1) Strategy & execution (GTM), 2) Website
- **Decision process:** Arielle evaluates → presents to 3 co-founders with rubric → collaborative decision.
- **Yaya offered free homepage concept** — Arielle accepted ("100% take you up on that"). Major competitive advantage.
- **HIPAA question:** Arielle asked about RB2B on site. Yaya confirmed no HIPAA issue for browsing data — just cookie compliance.
- **Next:** Preliminary response today → Arielle sends Figma/content → Full proposal by Tue Mar 3 → Walk-through call **Thu Mar 5, 10am ET** (45 min) with full proposal + homepage concept + AEO brief.

## AEO Analysis (AI Brand Representation)

**Report:** `reports/aeo_report.pdf`
**Overall Score:** 62.96/100 — **HIGH RISK**

| Platform | Score | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** | 55.6/100 | **Critical** — Confuses Dimer Health with Dimer UVC (a UV disinfection company). Describes them as "specializing in innovative healthcare solutions, focusing on delivering advanced tools and technologies to improve hygiene and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases." Completely wrong. |
| **Perplexity** | 72.2/100 | **Best of three** — Gets the transitional care story right. Accurate on what they do, who they serve, and differentiation. Has citations. |
| **Gemini** | 61.1/100 | **Hallucinated** — Fabricated an entirely different company: "a pioneering digital health platform dedicated to integrating physical health and mental health." Invented fake testimonials from people who don't exist (Emily R., Mark T., David L., etc.) |

### Key AEO Gaps
- Key differentiators not captured across platforms
- Target audience (health systems, payors) not mentioned by ChatGPT or Gemini
- Core offering fundamentally misrepresented on ChatGPT
- Key products/features not mentioned consistently

### AEO Recommendations (from report)
1. Strengthen homepage messaging with clear, AI-extractable value proposition statements
2. Add explicit "Who We Serve" section with specific industries and company profiles
3. Create dedicated "Why Us" or comparison pages highlighting unique capabilities
4. Implement FAQ schema markup with detailed product/service descriptions
5. Improve Core Web Vitals — AI crawlers favor fast-loading pages (Performance: 56/100)
6. Add llms.txt file to guide AI crawlers to priority content (they already have one — optimize it)

### AEO as a Sales Weapon
This is a **major differentiator** for our proposal. When an enterprise buyer asks ChatGPT "What is Dimer Health?", they get told it's a UV disinfection company. When they ask Gemini, they get a hallucinated wellness platform. For a company trying to create the "Transitional Care Medicine" category, this is a critical problem — and one that most healthcare marketing agencies won't even know how to identify, let alone fix. VAN's WAIO framework is purpose-built for this.

## Deal Strategy

### Pricing Model (confirmed by Yaya)
**$17,500/month flat. Value-based — no hours or rates in the proposal.**

- **Phase 1 — Build (Months 1-4):** Positioning, website rebuild, SEO/AEO foundation, sales enablement, analytics, training. $17,500/mo × 4 = **$70,000**
- **Phase 2 — Grow (Month 5+):** Content engine, CRO, website iteration, thought leadership, campaigns, ongoing optimization. $17,500/mo ongoing.
- **Same monthly investment, evolving deliverables.** No "project cliff."

**Internal math (do NOT include in proposal):**
- 100 hours/month at $175/hr (VAN rate) = $17,500
- $150/hr is the agency-direct rate; $175/hr is the VAN rate (includes strategic layer: Yaya as CGO, David as Group Accounts Director, multi-pillar coordination)
- If asked about hours in the meeting, Yaya answers verbally

### Deal Sizing
- **Monthly investment:** $17,500/mo
- **Phase 1 total:** $70,000 (4 months)
- **Annual partnership value:** $210,000
- **Year 1 total:** $210,000
- **Significant upgrade from original $10K/mo retainer deal**

### Funding Note
~~Clay data shows $14M Series A closed Oct 2024~~ — WRONG. Confirmed on call (Feb 27): Oct 2024 was a seed round, much smaller than $14M. **Series A closed last week (week of Feb 20, 2026).** Amount not disclosed. Funds going toward operational/programmatic tech growth + new product. Investor pressure to prove ROI in next 2 years. Lead investor: TechAviv.

### Competitive Position

**Strengths:**
- Already have a relationship with Arielle + discovery context
- Webflow expertise is a direct match (site is already on Webflow)
- VAN's multi-pillar model matches the RFP's multi-pillar ask perfectly
- AI/data-driven marketing (WAIO, AEO) aligns with their "use data and AI" requirement
- Enablement approach matches solo-marketer reality

**Gaps to address:**
- Healthcare-specific experience — Yaya says we have case studies coming
- Clinical buyer personas — new territory, need to show we can learn fast
- Category creation at this level — "Transitional Care Medicine" is ambitious
- No existing health system or payor client references (unless healthcare case studies change this)

### Differentiation Angle
- VAN is the only partner in their evaluation that can cover ALL 5 pillars under one roof
- Most healthcare marketing agencies are either strategy-only or execution-only — VAN does both
- The AI angle (WAIO/AEO) is genuinely differentiating in healthcare, where most agencies are behind on AI discoverability
- Webflow expertise specifically — their site is already on Webflow, and most healthcare agencies don't know Webflow
