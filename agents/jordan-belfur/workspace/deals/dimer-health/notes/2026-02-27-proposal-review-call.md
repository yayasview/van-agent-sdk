## Key Intel

### Funding — Confirmed
- Series A closed **last week** (week of Feb 20, 2026)
- Oct 2024 round was **seed** — much smaller than reported $14M (Crunchbase misinformation, Arielle aware and has tried to correct)
- Series A amount not disclosed on this call
- Funds going toward operational and programmatic tech growth + new product

### Growth Ambitions
- Goal: **10x the company in 2 years** (investor pressure)
- Current ARR: ~$1.7M
- Near-term target: ~$2-3M ARR by end of 2026
- Pressure from investors to prove ROI in next 2 years

### New Product
- New product in development — **beta in ~2 months**
- Already having conversations with CMOs for feedback
- Will flip Dimer from "clinic-forward, product-supported" → "product-forward, clinic-supported"
- Arielle can't share much yet — still trickle-down from co-founders

### Series A Announcement = The Big Moment
- Targeting **end of March** for public announcement
- Announcement will be the driver behind a bigger campaign — call to action for new business leads
- Arielle piecemealing vendors right now to get assets ready for launch
- Working with TechAviv (lead investor) on timing/alignment

### Agency Selection Timeline
- Wants agency **selected and running by end of March**
- Either: take the baton from piecemeal vendors post-announcement, or get pulled in mid-campaign
- Evaluating multiple agencies — wants apples-to-apples comparison
- Decision: Arielle evaluates → presents to **3 co-founders** with comparison rubric → collaborative decision
- Arielle will advocate for her pick and expects co-founders to defer somewhat ("they're dealing with so much")

### Website Direction
- **Staying on Webflow** — no platform change
- Not a rebrand: logo, colors, typography stay
- Wants a "glow up" — clean, clear, sophisticated, tech-forward but with compassion/empathy/human element
- Hates the current dull purple — has a better purple ready
- Homepage hero is too cluttered (video button + app store icons + banner = too much)
- **Two-sided experience needed:** patients + partners/health systems
- Patient narrative stays as North Star, but partner section is priority build
- Has **homepage content drafted** + **Figma mockup** she'll share
- Has "how it works" page drafted (currently missing from site)
- No lead capture on site currently — asked about RB2B overlay
- Yaya confirmed: no HIPAA issue for browsing data, just need cookie compliance (CA/NY laws)

### Priority Ranking (from Arielle)
1. **Strategy & execution** (go-to-market)
2. **Website** ("it's our face and it's a tool")

### Success Picture (6 months out)
- Leads coming from campaigns, not just personal network
- Strong pipeline with demos/meetings being booked for sales & BD team
- Content engine running — heavy initial build, then ongoing cadence
- Patient CLV extension via post-discharge email education campaign

### What They Want to See in Proposals
- Case studies / samples aligned with their company size
- Experience with companies that are both **service AND product**
- Breadth of healthcare experience
- Understanding of health system revenue cycles and buyer timing
- Clear menu of services within scope + fee structure

## Strategic Notes
- Yaya offered a **free homepage concept** — Arielle accepted enthusiastically ("I will 100% take you up on that")
- This gives VAN a tangible head start over other agencies in the process
- Arielle is the sole marketer — she's the champion AND the day-to-day partner
- Co-founders initially pushed back on website changes but now aligned post-Series A
- Arielle doesn't have healthcare background — explicitly wants agency to bring that expertise
- The new product launch + Series A announcement = two converging urgency drivers
