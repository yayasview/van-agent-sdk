# Dimer Health — Call Prep | Feb 27, 2026

**Call with:** Arielle Newcombe, Head of Marketing
**Purpose:** Scoping conversation — diagnose before prescribing
**Posture:** Expert advisor, not competing vendor
**Duration:** ~30 min

---

## Opening (2 min)

Set the frame: this is a conversation, not a pitch.

> "I read through the brief — the ambition has grown a lot since January, which is exciting. Before I put together a formal response, I want to make sure I understand what's actually driving this so we're not handing you something generic. Cool if I ask some questions first?"

---

## Discovery Questions (15-20 min)

### What changed

- What's driving the expanded scope? Board pressure post-Series A? New hires coming? Competitive urgency?
- You mentioned wrapping up the Series A — is that an extension of the Oct '24 round or something new?
- How does funding timeline affect when you want to kick off?

### Priorities

- The brief covers 5 big pillars. If you had to stack-rank them, what's urgent vs. important-but-not-yet?
- What does success look like 6 months out? If we're crushing it, what's different about Dimer's market position?
- Is the website the starting point, or is positioning/narrative the foundation everything else builds on?

### Team & capacity

- You've been running marketing solo — is that changing? Hiring plans?
- Is the partner meant to BE the marketing team, or augment a team you're building?
- How involved are Caroline and Gidon in marketing decisions day-to-day?

### Buying process

- Who else is part of this decision?
- What does the evaluation process look like after you get responses?
- How many agencies are you talking to? (don't need names — just calibrating)
- What's your ideal start date?

### What's been tried

- What did your current agency get right? What fell short?
- Any past experiences (good or bad) that are shaping what you're looking for?

## AEO Tease (3-5 min)

Drop the finding. Don't present the full report.

> "One thing — we ran your site through an AI brand representation tool we built in-house. It scores how accurately AI platforms describe your company to the people researching you. I don't want to bury the lede: ChatGPT is telling enterprise buyers that Dimer Health is a UV disinfection company. Gemini fabricated an entirely different business. For a company trying to define Transitional Care Medicine as a category, that's a real problem — and it's one most agencies won't even know how to find, let alone fix. I'll walk you through the full analysis when we present our response."

**Key:** Don't give away the full report or the scores. Let it create curiosity and a reason for the next meeting.

---

## Close (5 min)

Take control of the timeline.

> "This was really helpful. Based on what you've shared, I want to put together something specific to where you actually are — not a generic response to the brief. Can I get that to you by [Tuesday March 3]? And I'd want to walk you through it, especially the AI data — that's better shown than read. Can we book 45 minutes early next week?"

**Goal:** Walk away with a booked presentation call.

---

## Do NOT

- Present the deck
- Quote pricing ($17,500/mo)
- Walk through case studies
- Give away the full AEO report or scores
- Treat this as a pitch or defense

## Walk Away With

- [ ] Real priorities across the 5 pillars
- [ ] Buying process + who else decides
- [ ] Series A status and budget timing
- [ ] What's been tried / what failed
- [ ] Ideal start date
- [ ] Booked second call (presentation)
