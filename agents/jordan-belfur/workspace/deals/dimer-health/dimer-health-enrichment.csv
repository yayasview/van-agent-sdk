Founded by ER-trained licensed medical providers, our team understands just how vulnerable patients are during the post-discharge window, and how often they fall through the cracks.

We provide 24/7 virtual care immediately after hospital or medical facility discharge, following surgery, or after an emergency room visit. Through our proactive, physician-led model, patients receive continuous follow-up, medication reconciliation, remote monitoring, lab and imaging coordination, and direct access to a clinical team that’s available day or night.

For patients, Dimer Health means greater peace of mind, faster recovery, and fewer unnecessary trips back to the hospital.

For providers and surgeons, it’s a way to extend care beyond the walls of their practice, without adding to their workload.

For hospitals and health systems, we serve as a partner in reducing readmissions, improving throughput, and elevating patient satisfaction.

And for payors, Dimer Health delivers measurable cost savings by preventing complications, closing care gaps, and supporting value-based care delivery.

We work alongside clinical teams - never as a replacement, always as a trusted extension. Our mission is simple: help patients recover safely at home while supporting the providers and systems that care for them.","Hospitals and Health Care","2-10 employees",44,"SSL by Default, Google API, Google Font API, GStatic Google Static Content, Mobile Non Scaleable Content, Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, Copyright Year 2005, Google SSL, Google, IPv6, SPF, Google Apps for Business, Google Domains, Google DNS, Google Cloud DNS, Google Identity Platform, Google Registrar, Google Sites, Google Calendar, Apple Mobile Web Clips Icon, Content Delivery Network, Wix, lodash, Google Webmaster, Intersection Observer, Polyfill IO, Sentry, Wix Media, QUIC, HSTS, Google Cloud CDN, Google Cloud, Wix Chat, Wix Forms, Copyright Year 2016, Google AdsBot Disallow, Google AdsBot Mobile Disallow, LetsEncrypt, Wix DNS, core-js, Webpack, React, Sectigo SSL, Sectigo Domain SSL, Slack, Wix Hosted, Google Cloud Global Multi-Region, Nuxt.js, Global Site Tag, About Cookies, COVID-19, Amazon SSL, DNSSEC, Amazon, Amazon Ohio Region, Facebook, LinkedIn, AthenaHealth, Day.js, Amazon Route 53, Amazon S3 CDN, CrUX Dataset, CrUX Top 50m, Google Tag Manager, US Privacy User Signal Mechanism, jQuery, DoubleClick.Net, Google Analytics, Vue Instantiated, Facebook SDK, Google Analytics 4, Facebook for Websites, Facebook Pixel, Facebook Custom Audiences, JavaScript Modules, Vue, Google Conversion Linker, Google AdWords Conversion, Artificial Intelligence, DMARC, English - Inferred, GSAP, matchMedia, Webflow, CloudFront, YouTube Link, jQuery 2.1.3, AJAX Libraries API, Embedly, jsDelivr, CDN JS, Google Hosted Libraries, WebFont Loader, Google Hosted Web Font Loader, Cloudflare JS, jQuery Waypoints, Cloudflare CDN, AWS Lambda, AWS Global Accelerator, Webflow Hosting, Cloudflare Bot Manager, jQuery 3.5.1, Underscore.js, CookieYes, Microsoft Clarity, Google Adsense, LinkedIn Insights, LinkedIn Ads, DMARC None, CommonCrawl Top 50m, Apple App Link, Google Play Store Link, DMARC Quarantine, Careers, CrUX Top 10m, Optibase, Intercom, U.S. Server Location, LLMS Text, CommonCrawl Top 1m, Common Crawl, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Mumbai Region, Amazon Oregon Region, Cloudflare, Fastly Hosted, Fastly Load Balancer, Instagram",true,,87,100,56,"✅ Top Pages Found","dimerhealth.com",425,167,"Dimer Health is a company specializing in innovative healthcare solutions, focusing on delivering...","**Dimer Health is an AI-powered clinical service platform and telehealth provider specializing in transitional care medicine, offering 24/7 personalized recovery support for patients after hospital discharge to prevent readmissions and ensure smooth transitions to home care.[1][2][3][4]**

## Dimer Health: Bridging the Gaps in Personalized Wellness

**Dimer Health** is a pioneering digital health platform dedicated to integrating and optimizing two critical facets of an individual's well-being: **physical health and mental health**. Recognizing that these two elements are inextricably linked and often overlooked in a fragmented healthcare system, Dimer Health aims to provide a unified, personalized, and proactive approach to holistic wellness.

### What They Do

1.  **Integrated Health Assessments:** Users complete an in-depth assessment covering physical health metrics (diet, exercise, sleep, chronic conditions) and mental health indicators (stress levels, mood, cognitive function).
2.  **Personalized Wellness Plans:** Based on the assessments, Dimer Health generates highly customized plans that address both physical and mental well-being simultaneously. These plans include tailored nutrition guidance, exercise routines, mindfulness exercises, stress management techniques, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) informed modules.
3.  **Virtual Coaching & Support:** Users are paired with a dedicated Dimer Coach – a certified professional with expertise spanning both physical fitness/nutrition and mental health counseling. These coaches provide regular check-ins, motivation, and guidance.
4.  **AI-Driven Progress Tracking & Adjustments:** The platform continuously monitors user progress, provides actionable insights, and dynamically adjusts wellness plans to ensure optimal effectiveness.
5.  **Community & Resources:** Access to a supportive online community, educational content, virtual workshops, and curated resources (e.g., guided meditations, healthy recipes, sleep stories).
6.  **Preventative Care Focus:** A strong emphasis on preventing chronic diseases and mental health challenges through early intervention and sustainable lifestyle changes.

### What Makes Them Different

2.  **Human-Tech Hybrid Model:** They combine the scalability and data-driven insights of AI with the empathy, accountability, and personalized touch of human coaches, avoiding a purely automated or purely manual approach.
3.  **Proactive & Preventative Focus:** Their emphasis is on building long-term sustainable habits and preventing issues before they escalate, rather than just reactive treatment.
4.  **Personalization at Scale:** While highly individualized, their advanced algorithms ensure that millions can receive bespoke care without compromising quality.
