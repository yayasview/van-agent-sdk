### Slide 1 — COVER

**Layout:** Dark background, VAN logo, gradient accent line

```
[VAN LOGO]

Dimer Health
Marketing & Growth Partnership

Proposal & Approach  |  February 2026

Prepared by Yannick Lorenz, Veza Agency Network
```

---

### Slide 2 — THE MOMENT

**Layout:** Split. Left = bold stat + context. Right = why now.

**Left panel (dark):**
```
Seed funded. Category defined.
Now the world needs to hear about it.
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
THE MOMENT

You're building something new —
Transitional Care Medicine
isn't just a service line,
it's a category.

Your next phase of growth requires a digital
presence and go-to-market engine that matches
the ambition of what you've built clinically.
```

> **Notes:** This mirrors the "2022" slide from the Lessen deck but instead of a problem date, we lead with the funding milestone and category ambition. Sets the tone as forward-looking, not deficit-focused.

---

### Slide 3 — THE PROBLEM: AI DOESN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

**Layout:** Split. Left = AEO score + platform breakdown. Right = specific misrepresentations with icon cards.

**Left panel (dark):**
```
62.96
Your AEO Score (out of 100)

How accurately AI platforms
describe Dimer Health to the
enterprise buyers researching you.

HIGH RISK
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
AI BRAND REPRESENTATION

When enterprise buyers ask AI
about Dimer Health, here's
what they're told:

[icon] ChatGPT (55.6/100)
       Confuses you with a UV disinfection company.
       Describes "tools to improve hygiene and
       mitigate infectious diseases."

[icon] Gemini (61.1/100)
       Fabricated a completely different company.
       Invented fake testimonials from people
       who don't exist.

[icon] Perplexity (72.2/100)
       Gets the transitional care story mostly right.
       Only platform with accurate citations.
```

> **Notes:** This is our unique wedge. No other agency responding to this RFP will show them this data. ChatGPT literally confusing them with a UV disinfection company is devastating for a company trying to define a new category.

---

### Slide 4 — GAP ANALYSIS: CLINICAL REALITY VS. DIGITAL PRESENCE

**Layout:** Split. Left = gap table. Right = summary statement.

**Left panel (light):**
```
GAP ANALYSIS

Current State vs. Digital Presence

| Clinical reality              | What the site shows           |
| 67-68% readmission reduction  | No outcomes data on site      |
| RWJBarnabas, Atlantic Health, | No partner logos or            |
| EmblemHealth partnerships     | case studies                  |
| AiME AI companion launched    | Not featured prominently      |
| 4.9/5 patient rating          | No social proof visible       |
| 3,000+ patients served        | No scale indicators           |
| Enterprise health system      | Patient-facing messaging only |
| sales motion                  |                               |
```

**Right panel (dark):**
```
REALITY

Your clinical outcomes are
extraordinary. 67% fewer
readmissions. 4.9/5 ratings.
>4.5x ROI for partners.

DIGITAL PRESENCE

Still communicates a validation-
stage company — not the enterprise
platform redefining post-discharge
medicine.
```

> **Notes:** Direct parallel to the "Current State vs. Website Narrative" slide from the Lessen deck. The gap between what Dimer IS and what their website SHOWS is the core tension.

---

### Slide 5 — SITE ANALYSIS

**Layout:** Split. Left = key stats (big numbers). Right = technical & messaging audit (icon cards).

**Left panel (dark):**
```
KEY FINDINGS

56/100    Performance score
          (Lighthouse)

100/100   Technical SEO score
          (strong foundation)

425       Monthly site visits
          (validation tool, not
          growth engine)

1         Conversion path
          (no persona-based routing)
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
SITE ANALYSIS

Technical & messaging
audit

[icon] Patient-facing messaging only — no language
       for health system CFOs, CMOs, or ops leaders

[icon] No buyer-persona navigation — enterprise
       visitors and patients share the same journey

[icon] No content engine — no blog, case studies,
       white papers, or thought leadership

[icon] Performance bottleneck at 56/100 — impacts
       both user experience and AI crawlability

[icon] CMS underutilized — marketing can't publish
       without developer involvement
```

> **Notes:** The 56 performance score + 425 monthly visits tell the story numerically. The right panel shows specifically what's broken from a messaging and architecture standpoint.

---

### Slide 6 — THE OPPORTUNITY

**Layout:** Split. Left = bold headline + opportunity bullets. Right = impact statement.

**Left panel (light):**
```
THE OPPORTUNITY

Build the digital engine
for Transitional Care
Medicine

[icon] Define and own the category digitally —
       before a competitor does

[icon] Transform the site from validation tool
       to enterprise growth engine

[icon] Equip enterprise buyers with the proof
       points they need to say yes

[icon] Fix AI representation so the category
       you're creating actually reaches buyers

[icon] Give marketing the infrastructure
       to scale without engineering dependency
```

**Right panel (dark):**
```
MARKET IMPACT

$62B / year
lost to hospital readmissions
in the U.S.

You've proven you can solve this.
The market needs to know that —
through every channel enterprise
buyers use to evaluate partners.

That starts with the website,
extends to AI platforms, and
scales through content, collateral,
and sales enablement.
```

---

### Slide 7 — YOUR RFP, OUR CAPABILITIES

**Layout:** Full-width mapping visual. Shows their 5 RFP pillars mapped to VAN's service pillars.

```
YOUR NEEDS, OUR NETWORK

Dimer Health RFP                    VAN Capability
─────────────────                   ──────────────

Positioning &           ──────►    Brand Strategy
Narrative                          & Consulting

Go-To-Market &          ──────►    Strategy &
Growth Strategy                    Consulting

Website Strategy,       ──────►    Digital Experience
Dev & Optimization                 (Webflow Enterprise)

Marketing               ──────►    SEO, Content &
Execution                          Brand

Sales & BD              ──────►    Strategy &
Enablement                         Consulting


Most agencies cover one or two of these pillars.
VAN covers all five — under one roof, one team, one relationship.
```

> **Notes:** This is a slide that doesn't exist in the Lessen deck because Lessen was website-only. For Dimer, showing the 1:1 RFP-to-capability mapping is critical. It answers the question "can you actually do all of this?" visually.

---

### Slide 8 — OUR APPROACH: BUILD, THEN GROW

**Layout:** Split. Left = two-phase model overview. Right = why this structure works.

**Left panel (dark):**
```
OUR APPROACH

Two phases.
One monthly investment.

PHASE 1 — BUILD
Months 1-4
Strategy, positioning, website rebuild,
foundational assets, SEO/AEO

PHASE 2 — GROW
Month 5+
Content engine, CRO, thought leadership,
campaign support, ongoing optimization
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
WHY THIS MODEL

Same monthly budget.
Different deliverables.

Phase 1 builds the foundation — the positioning,
the website, the sales materials, the AI
discoverability framework.

Phase 2 activates it — ongoing content, conversion
optimization, thought leadership, and campaign
execution.

No "project cliff." No re-onboarding.
The team that builds it is the team that grows it.
```

> **Notes:** This directly addresses Yaya's pricing model direction: monthly billing, project → retainer, same budget. The "no project cliff" line is key — it's what differentiates us from agencies that build and walk away.

---

### Slide 9 — PHASE 1: BUILD (Months 1-4)

**Layout:** Split. Left = bold deliverable cards (grid). Right = scope summary with big numbers.

**Left panel (light):**
```

       thought leadership                 conversion tracking,
       plan, content templates            baseline metrics
```

**Right panel (dark):**
```
SCOPE SUMMARY

       with 3 buyer persona variants

10-15  Core page templates
       (rebuilt or new)

3-5    CMS collection templates
       (case studies, resources, blog)

1      WAIO implementation

       + use-case one-pagers

Also includes:

```

---

### Slide 10 — PHASE 2: GROW (Month 5+)

**Layout:** Split. Left = ongoing deliverable categories. Right = what scales.

**Left panel (dark):**
```
PHASE 2: GROW

Ongoing monthly
partnership

Monthly deliverables adapt based on
priorities. Typical month includes:

[icon] Content production
       Blog posts, case studies,
       white papers, POVs

[icon] Conversion optimization
       A/B testing, CRO experiments,
       form optimization

[icon] Website iteration
       New pages, feature builds,
       design updates

[icon] Thought leadership
       Ghostwriting, speaking prep,
       social content

[icon] Campaign support
       Landing pages, collateral,
       launch materials
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
WHAT SCALES WITH YOU

As Dimer grows, the partnership grows.

Month 5-6: Content engine + CRO baseline
Month 7-9: Thought leadership + case study development
Month 10-12: Campaign support + demand gen foundation

Optional future expansions:
- Paid media (geotargeted + LinkedIn)
- Conference strategy
- PR & earned media
- Account-based marketing

Same team. Same relationship. Expanding scope.
```

> **Notes:** This shows the retainer isn't just "maintenance" — it's a growth engine with a roadmap. The optional expansions map directly to their RFP "nice-to-haves."

### Slide 11 — TIMELINE

**Layout:** Visual timeline bar + phase cards (similar to Lessen deck slide 8).

```

### Slide 12 — WHY VAN

**Layout:** Split. Left = bold headline + stat. Right = differentiator cards.

**Left panel (dark):**
```
WHY VAN

Strategic depth.
Executional range.
One partnership.

VAN is a network of specialized agencies
operating as one team — bringing boutique
expertise with enterprise-grade delivery
across every pillar of your growth engine.

150+
Webflow projects delivered
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
DIFFERENTIATORS

[icon] Full-Pillar Coverage
       Strategy, brand, website, content, SEO, sales
       enablement — all under one roof

[icon] AI Discoverability Expertise (WAIO)
       Purpose-built framework for AI-era brand
       visibility — your competitors don't have this

[icon] Webflow Enterprise Partner
       Your site is already on Webflow — we're
       certified specialists, not generalists learning

[icon] Enablement-First Approach
       We build capability, not dependency — your
       team will own and scale independently

[icon] Enterprise B2B Experience
       Complex buyer journeys, multi-persona sites,
       long sales cycles — this is our core
```

---

### Slide 13 — CASE STUDIES

**Layout:** Split. Left = headline + summary stat. Right = 2 case study cards with metrics.

**Left panel (dark):**
```
HEALTHCARE
EXPERIENCE

Two enterprise health tech
companies. Same challenges
you're facing.

Both started as builds.
Both became ongoing
growth partnerships.
```

**Right panel (light):**
```
ADONIS — AI Healthcare Revenue Cycle
$31M Series B | Health systems, hospitals, physician groups

Full rebrand + Webflow development → 1+ year
ongoing marketing, content, and SEO partnership

• Enterprise martech integration (HubSpot, A/B testing, analytics)
• Multi-persona site (clinical, operational, financial buyers)
• Content engine: weekly publishing across 6+ categories
• Full-service: strategy → design → dev → growth


GALILEO — Virtual Primary Care Platform
Founded by the creator of One Medical

Migration + ongoing support → multi-vertical
consolidation, positioning, campaign launches

• Consolidated 3 buyer journeys (patients, employers, health plans)
• Persona-specific messaging, proof points, and conversion paths
• 40%+ member engagement, 70% fewer ER visits, 80+ NPS
• Unified brand narrative across all audience segments
```

> **Notes:** Both cases directly mirror Dimer's situation: healthcare companies selling to enterprise buyers AND patients, needing multi-audience architecture, and wanting an ongoing partner (not a vendor who builds and leaves). Adonis shows we can do full-service healthcare from rebrand through content engine. Galileo shows we can consolidate verticals and build multi-persona experiences — exactly what Dimer needs for their health system + patient dual audience.

### Slide 14 — PROPOSED TEAM

**Layout:** Two rows of team cards. Top row = leadership (3). Bottom row = specialists (6). Each card has photo, name, title, and role on this engagement.

**Top row (leadership):**
```

                            enablement copy.
```

> **Notes:** 9-person team covering all 5 RFP pillars. Yaya as strategic lead shows CGO-level commitment — Arielle knows him from every call. David runs the engagement day-to-day. The specialist layer maps directly to the RFP: dev (Muhammad), design (Inna), SEO/AEO (Mina), content/positioning (Ivana), marketing execution (Alberto). Still need Alberto's last name and title.

### Slide 15 — INVESTMENT

**Layout:** Dark background. Big number centered + two-column deliverable breakdown below. Value-based — no hours, no hourly rates.

```
INVESTMENT

$17,500 / month
One partnership. Evolving deliverables.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 1: Build (Months 1-4)                    Phase 2: Grow (Month 5+)

• Positioning & messaging framework            • Content production & publishing
  by buyer persona (clinical,                  • Conversion rate optimization
  operational, financial)                      • Website iteration & new pages
• Website strategy & rebuild                   • Thought leadership
  (IA, UX/UI, Webflow development)              (white papers, POVs, ghostwriting)
• SEO & AEO foundation                        • Campaign support & launch materials
  (WAIO implementation)                        • Sales collateral updates
• Sales enablement assets                      • Ongoing SEO & AEO optimization
  (pitch deck, one-pagers, demo narrative)     • Monthly strategy calls
• Analytics & measurement setup
• Team training & CMS enablement


Total Phase 1 investment: $70,000
Annual partnership value: $210,000

Includes: 9-person dedicated team, monthly strategy calls,
direct access to strategic lead
```

> **Notes:** Value selling — no hours or hourly rates in the deck. $17,500/mo flat across both phases. If Arielle asks about hours in the meeting, Yaya can answer verbally ($175/hr, ~100 hrs/mo). The framing is "one investment, evolving deliverables" — not "buying hours." Total Year 1 = $210K. Internal math: 100 hrs/mo × $175/hr = $17,500.

### Slide 16 — NEXT STEPS / CLOSE

## Outline Notes

### What's different from the Lessen deck:
1. **AEO slide (Slide 3)** — Unique weapon. No other agency will show them AI misrepresentation data. This is our differentiation play.
2. **RFP mapping slide (Slide 7)** — Shows we read and responded to every pillar. Demonstrates VAN's full-network value.
3. **Two-phase model (Slides 8-10)** — Lessen was project-only. Dimer is project → retainer. Needs dedicated slides to explain the model.
4. **Phase 2 slide (Slide 10)** — Shows the retainer isn't maintenance — it's a growth engine with a roadmap.
5. **Team slide (Slide 14)** — RFP explicitly asks for team structure. Lessen didn't need this.

### What we still need from Yaya:
- [x] Healthcare case studies — **DONE: Adonis (Veza Digital) + Galileo (Shadow Digital)**
- [x] Team structure — **DONE: 9-person team (Yaya, David, Brian, Dimitrije, Muhammad, Inna, Mina, Ivana, Alberto)**
- [x] Monthly budget range — **DONE: $17,500/mo flat, value-based (no hours in deck)**
- [x] Two-phase model — **APPROVED: Build (1-4) → Grow (5+), same monthly investment**
- [ ] Alberto's last name and title
- [ ] Any additional discovery call notes (beyond Jan 22)

### Slide count: 16 slides
Lessen deck was 13. We're 3 slides more because of the broader scope (RFP mapping, two-phase model, team). Could trim by combining slides 9+10 into one if needed.
