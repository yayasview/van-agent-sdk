## 1. The Opportunity

CapGrow Partners has spent 20 years building something rare — a trusted real estate platform that's helped behavioral health providers across 42 states focus on care instead of property management. Inc. 5000 eight years running. 1,300+ properties. 70+ provider partnerships. The track record speaks for itself.

The problem is, your website doesn't.

Today, CapGrow's digital presence runs on an aging WordPress site built on a finance-industry template. It wasn't designed to explain what CapGrow actually does — and as a result, first-time visitors often walk away confused. Provider executives wonder if CapGrow runs the facilities. PE firms can't quickly assess the investment model. And smaller operators — the ones who'd benefit most — sometimes question whether the offer is legitimate. When your website creates more questions than it answers, every conference handshake has to work twice as hard.

Meanwhile, the competitive landscape has shifted. Both Scioto Properties and Nested have recently redesigned their digital presence, raising the visual bar for the behavioral health real estate category. CapGrow's business model is different from both — but online, the distinction is invisible.

This isn't just a branding exercise. CapGrow's BD team has tripled in the last year. Dené, Lexi, and Addie are out at conferences, building relationships, handing out cards — and every one of those prospects comes home and checks the website. The site is the second impression for every first conversation. Right now, it's undermining the work your team is doing in the field.

The opportunity: build a digital presence that matches the business CapGrow has already built. A site that instantly communicates the model, projects 20 years of credibility, and gives Sydney the tools to create targeted landing pages for every conference and campaign — without waiting on developers or fighting a plugin-heavy CMS.

## 2. Expected Outcomes

**Instant clarity for every audience** — C-suite executives, non-financial providers, and PE firms will each understand CapGrow's model within seconds of landing on the site. No more "wait, do you run the houses?" confusion.

**Marketing team independence** — Sydney will be able to create, edit, and launch custom landing pages for conferences, campaigns, and partner outreach without writing code or submitting dev tickets. What currently takes weeks will take hours.

**A brand that matches the business** — The site will project 20 years of sustained success — approachable enough for a two-home provider, credible enough for a PE-backed organization evaluating a $100M portfolio deal.

**Competitive differentiation** — Visitors will immediately see how CapGrow is different from Scioto (larger, PE-focused) and Nested (younger, tech-forward). The positioning won't just be different — it'll be *clear*.

**A scalable content engine** — Blog content, case studies, provider spotlights, and news will live in a structured CMS that's easy to maintain and built for organic growth. Years of existing blog content preserved and migrated.

**Conference-ready landing pages on demand** — Sydney will be able to spin up a branded, targeted landing page for any conference or campaign in hours — not weeks. No dev tickets, no plugin workarounds, no waiting.

**A site that works as hard as your BD team** — Long sales cycles mean prospects come back to the website multiple times before signing. The new site will serve as a nurture tool — answering objections, building trust, and moving prospects forward between meetings.

## 3. Our Approach

We work in gated phases — each one builds on the last, each one requires your sign-off before we move forward. Nothing gets built that your team hasn't approved, and nothing gets approved that doesn't map back to your business goals. Given the strong internal voices on your team, this structure is intentional — it gives everyone a clear moment to weigh in, react to real visuals, and make decisions before we build further.

**Phase 1 — Align** — We start by getting on the same page about who the site is really for and what it needs to say. We'll map your three audience segments, define the messaging hierarchy, and lock in the sitemap and content strategy. You'll walk away with a blueprint that the whole team has signed off on before a single pixel gets designed.

**Phase 2 — Design & Build** — You'll see your core pages come to life in a staging environment early, giving your team something real to react to — not static mockups that feel abstract. We build in Webflow from the start, so what you're reviewing is what you're getting. The component library gets built alongside the pages, so Sydney has a toolkit of pre-approved elements to remix later.

**Phase 3 — Content & Migration** — Blog content, case studies, and institutional pages get migrated with SEO intact. We handle redirect mapping, metadata, and schema markup so nothing gets lost in the transition. New content structures make it easy to keep publishing after launch.

**Phase 4 — Launch & Enable** — Before go-live, we run a full quality pass across browsers and devices. Then we hand you the keys — with documentation, a hands-on walkthrough, and a dedicated support window so the transition feels seamless, not stressful.

We'll need your team engaged at key approval gates — typically 2-3 touchpoints per phase. Between gates, we execute. You don't need to manage us.

## 6. Why Shadow Digital

**WordPress-to-Webflow is our core competency** — We've executed 50+ enterprise migrations from WordPress, HubSpot, and custom platforms to Webflow. This isn't a side service — it's the foundation of our practice. We know where the bodies are buried with plugin-heavy WordPress sites, and plugin-heavy is an understatement for what's running on capgrowpartners.com today.

**We've solved the complex messaging problem before** — Multi-audience companies with misunderstood business models are our sweet spot. We migrated Mizuho Bank's entire global web presence to Webflow — a regulated financial institution with similar complexity around audience segmentation, credibility signaling, and regulatory nuance. Their marketing team went from a multi-week content cycle to same-day publishing.

**We haven't worked with a REIT — but we've worked in your world.** Our experience spans financial services, fintech, and PE-backed companies where trust, compliance, and institutional credibility are non-negotiable. The challenges CapGrow faces — explaining a complex model to multiple audiences, projecting stability without feeling corporate, balancing accessibility with sophistication — are the exact problems we solve.

**Enablement-first, not dependency-first** — Every engagement ends with your team trained and independent. We don't build sites that require you to call us every time you need a new page. The component library and documentation ensure your marketing team can operate autonomously post-launch.

**Built for stakeholder-driven design** — We've worked with leadership teams that have strong visual opinions and high expectations. Our gated approval process gives every stakeholder clear touchpoints to weigh in on real pages — not abstract wireframes — so feedback stays grounded, productive, and doesn't loop.

**Full-stack when you need it** — Shadow Digital is part of a broader network covering brand, digital experience, SEO, performance marketing, and strategy. You get boutique-level focus on your project with enterprise-level depth behind it. If CapGrow's needs expand into content strategy, paid media, or ongoing SEO, the team is already here.

## 7. Select Case Studies

**Bench** — *Fintech | WordPress → Webflow Migration*
Bench came to us with 1,000+ content pieces trapped in a legacy WordPress CMS that their marketing team couldn't manage independently. We migrated the full library, rebuilt their content architecture in Webflow, and gave their team the tools to publish without engineering support. Within 6 months of launch: 450 new pages created by the marketing team alone, organic keywords grew from 2,000 to 4,900, and the site hit a performance score of 96. Page creation capacity tripled — the team went from waiting on dev tickets to publishing same-day.

**TSIA** — *Technology Services | Enterprise Webflow Migration*
TSIA needed 200+ pages migrated from a legacy platform to Webflow — without losing search equity or breaking member-facing workflows. We completed the full migration in 6 weeks, improved mobile page speed by 112%, and preserved their entire SEO footprint through redirect mapping and metadata migration. Their team called it "an outstanding performance — delivered on time, on budget, and beyond expectations."

**Sterling Bank** — *Financial Services | WordPress → Webflow*
Sterling Bank's marketing team was dependent on their engineering department for every website update — a bottleneck that slowed campaigns and limited their ability to respond to market conditions. We migrated their site to Webflow with a component library designed for marketing independence. Post-launch, their team manages the site end-to-end without developer involvement — the same outcome we're designing for Sydney and the CapGrow marketing function.

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Review this proposal** with your team
2. **Walkthrough call** — We'll discuss questions, refine scope, and finalize the package (scheduled: February 26)
3. **SOW delivery** — We'll send the detailed Statement of Work with deliverables, hours, and terms based on what we align on
4. **Sign & kick off** — Lock in the engagement and schedule kickoff within 1 week of signing

Your BD team is actively driving traffic to a site that doesn't convert — every week without a new presence is a week of lost follow-through from conferences and prospect conversations. With Scioto and Nested having already redesigned, the window to lead the category is now.

*Post-launch, we also offer ongoing support retainers for continued optimization, content updates, and campaign support — happy to discuss once the site is live.*
