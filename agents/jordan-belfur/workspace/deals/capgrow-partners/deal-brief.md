## Meeting History

### Discovery Call — Feb 19, 2026
**Attendees:** Yaya, Sydney Gutierrez

**Project scope:** Started as a "facelift" — has evolved into full rip-and-replace. Complete redesign + rebrand, WordPress/Bluehost → Webflow.

**Why now:**
- Direct competitors (Scioto Properties, Nested) both redesigned in the last year
- C-suite push to modernize in response to competitive pressure
- Need to differentiate — all three look similar online despite being different businesses
- Current site literally sounds "borderline like a scam" to uninitiated prospects

**Current state:**
- WordPress on Bluehost — old, plugin-heavy (Financity theme, Visual Composer, Revolution Slider)
- "Ball of duct tape" — pull one thread and it all falls apart
- Sydney cannot create custom landing pages for conferences/events
- No HTML/dev skills on marketing team
- Years of blog content needing SEO migration
- No paid ads — too broad an audience to target effectively
- Traffic from in-person behavioral health conferences
- Website serves as "billboard" — conference leads check it, then book calls

**Target audiences (ranked):**
1. C-suite decision makers with finance/investment backgrounds (PRIMARY)
2. Smaller providers — need to disqualify early if too small
3. PE firms / direct competitors — awareness

**Unwanted traffic:** Parents looking to lease homes for kids — must immediately signal "businesses, not individuals."

**Stakeholder dynamics:**
- CEO Matt Pettinelli is the loudest voice in the room
- Requires visual mockups throughout
- Past design processes have been "contentious"
- Makes "circular decisions"
- Sydney is trying to push modern marketing, team has legacy instincts

**What they want in a partner:**
1. Adaptable CMS they can manage independently
2. Revision flexibility for strong internal voices
3. Thought partnership — push back with rationale, not just execute
4. Training and enablement
5. Quick landing page capability for conferences

**Sydney's ask:** REIT industry case studies — has VAN worked with REITs? Closest: Mizuho Bank, fintech/PE portfolio.

## Current Website / Tech Stack

- **CMS:** WordPress (old, plugin-heavy)
- **Hosting:** Bluehost
- **Theme:** "Financity" (finance WordPress theme)
- **Page Builder:** Visual Composer
- **Business Tools:** Microsoft 365, Salesforce
- **Design:** Functional but dated. Finance-heavy aesthetic doesn't translate to non-financial audiences.
- **Tagline:** "Leasing with a Purpose"
- **Structure:** Homepage, About/Team, Why Choose CapGrow, Lease Solutions, News/Blog, Contact

## Competitors

| Competitor | Positioning | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Scioto Properties** | Larger, PE-focused, publicly announces acquisitions | High-volume, established |
| **Nested** | Younger team, tech/automated approach | All-male team, between CapGrow and Scioto in size |

---

## What They Need

1. Full website redesign + rebrand (WordPress → Webflow)
2. Component library / design system (so Sydney can build pages independently)
3. Training & enablement for one-woman marketing team
4. Custom landing page capability for conference campaigns
5. SEO migration (years of blog content to preserve)
6. AEO/SEO strategy for behavioral health niche
7. Brand positioning to differentiate from Scioto (big/PE) and Nested (young/tech)
8. Revision-friendly process (CEO needs visual mockups, expects heavy input)

---

## Proposal Approach

Yaya committed to an **a la carte menu** — Sydney picks what resonates, presents to team:
- Design system + component library
- Website redesign + development (WordPress → Webflow migration)
- Training & enablement
- SEO/AEO
- Automations
- Blog/content migration

## Deal Status & Risks

- **URGENT:** Proposal review call is **tomorrow, Feb 26 at 2pm CT**
- **Proposal needs to be ready** — Yaya committed to Monday/Tuesday delivery
- **No REIT case studies** — closest is Mizuho Bank / fintech portfolio
- **CEO risk:** Matt Pettinelli has strong opinions and circular decision-making. Design process will be contentious.
- **Small team:** Sydney is a one-woman marketing team. Enablement is critical.
- **Deal flagged "stalled"** in HubSpot — needs stage update after proposal delivery

### Immediate Actions
1. Finalize and deliver proposal TODAY
2. Prepare competitor teardown of Scioto + Nested sites for the call
3. Update HubSpot deal stage after proposal delivery
