## Client Pain Points & Requirements

### Core Problem
Their current website fundamentally fails to explain what CapGrow does. The business model — leasing homes to behavioral health providers — is inherently complex and often misunderstood. The site needs to make this immediately clear while projecting 20 years of credibility.

### Specific Issues with Current Site
1. **Imagery confusion** — Photos are vague and don't represent what they do or who they partner with
2. **Insider language** — Too much jargon for organizations being introduced to the concept
3. **Insufficient institutional content** — Not enough qualitative info for larger organizations
4. **Buried value props** — Goal information is hidden behind oversimplified messaging
5. **Undefined customer journey** — ICP is unclear, so content stays vague
6. **No landing pages** — Can't customize for evolving sales/ad focus areas
7. **Doesn't drive understanding** — If an ICP can't quickly grasp the offering, they disengage

### Brand Positioning Goals
- Move away from generic, template-like look
- Appear approachable yet established (not "too good to be true")
- Project 20 years of sustained success
- NOT look like a bank or expensive lifestyle brand
- Balance accessibility for small mom-and-pop providers AND large institutional/PE-backed orgs
- Sleek animations, optimized layout, flexible to grow with evolving messaging

## Target Audiences (from Brand Primer)

### 1. Behavioral Health Industry Insiders (Non-Financial)
- Any/all job titles within provider organizations
- Need: "Explain what you do" and "Tell me what you can do for me"
- Care about: residents, affordability, quality of care, transparency, simplicity, immediacy
- Design: Affordable-looking but established

### 2. Industry-Specific Reps with Financial Knowledge
- C-suite, Board Members, R&D, BD, Founders with residential titles
- Need: Consistency, longevity, competency, accessibility on their terms
- Care about: 1:1 relationships with CapGrow reps, testimonials, privacy, exclusivity, company size flexibility
- Design: Cohesive but not corporate/bank-like

### 3. Financially-Minded Reps
- CFOs, Investment Bankers, PE Firms, PE-backed organizations
- Need: Understand offerings at a glance, polished branding, proof of success
- Care about: Stats, funds availability, proof of concept, scale, investment viability
- Design: Data-forward, credibility signals

## Common Misunderstandings to Address in UX
- "Can you lease a house to my brother?" → No, we work with provider companies only
- "Do you run the houses?" → No, we only own real estate
- "Oh you're a landlord" → Partnership model, not transactional landlord
- "Oh you're a bank" → Non-traded REIT, but we just own the homes
- "You own nursing homes?" → No, not memory care or elder care

## How CapGrow Finds Business
- **Travel:** 3 BD reps, ~40% travel to conferences, trade shows, client dinners
- **Referrals:** Small, tight-knit industry
- **Repeat business:** Existing partners expand
- **Industry ads:** Direct-click to website

## Key Selling Points for Proposal
- WordPress → Webflow migration is our bread and butter
- Complex messaging challenge = high-value strategic engagement
- 3 distinct audience segments = significant IA and content strategy work
- Long sales cycles (6mo–6yr) mean the website is a critical nurture tool
- Landing page needs = ongoing CMS flexibility (Webflow strength)
- $10K/yr maintenance = retainer opportunity post-launch
