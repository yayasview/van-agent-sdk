## Website Traffic

**491 monthly visitors**

This is extremely low. For a company with 1,300+ properties across 42 states, the website is essentially invisible online. Their traffic comes from conferences and direct outreach, not digital channels. This is a massive opportunity — and a strong argument for why the website needs to be completely rebuilt.

## Headcount Growth

| Period | Headcount | Growth |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Current | 14 | — |
| 1 month ago | 14 | 0% |
| 3 months ago | 14 | 0% |
| 6 months ago | 14 | 0% |
| 12 months ago | 13 | +7.7% |
| 24 months ago | 10 | +40% |
| 36 months ago | 10 | +40% |
| 60 months ago | 11 | +27.3% |

Key insight: 40% headcount growth over the last 2-3 years (10 → 14), with most hiring in BD and accounting. They're investing in growth infrastructure, which signals readiness for a better digital presence.

## Tech Stack (Website)

**CMS:** WordPress (versions 3.9 through 4.5 detected — very outdated)
**Hosting:** BlueHost / HostMonster
**Theme:** Financity (GoodLayers)
**Page Builder:** Visual Composer / WPBakery
**Plugins:** Slider Revolution, Essential Grid, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO Premium, Download Monitor, reCAPTCHA, MailChimp, WP Google Map Plugin
**Server:** nginx (versions 1.8 through 1.17)
**SSL:** LetsEncrypt, Comodo PositiveSSL
**Analytics:** Google Analytics (Classic + Universal), Google Tag Manager, Google AdWords Conversion, DoubleClick
**JavaScript:** jQuery 3.7.1, GSAP, Modernizr, various jQuery plugins
**Social:** Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest integrations
**Schema:** Thing, Review, Person, CreativeWork, Sitelinks Search Box

**Assessment:** This is a legacy WordPress stack that hasn't been fundamentally updated in years. Multiple outdated jQuery plugins, old WordPress versions referenced, and a finance-specific theme that limits design flexibility. The migration to Webflow will eliminate the plugin dependency, improve performance, and give the team control.

- BD team expanded significantly (Dené, Lexi, Addie all joined mid-2024)
- No dedicated design or dev roles — confirms Sydney is running marketing solo
- The company is clearly investing in growth (BD + accounting hires) while the website has been left behind
