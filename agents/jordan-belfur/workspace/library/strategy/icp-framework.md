# **VAN Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**

**ABM – Q1 Foundation Memo**

This memo defines VAN’s Ideal Customer Profile for our enterprise ABM motion. It is designed to align sales, growth, content, and partnerships around **who we target, why they buy, and when we engage**. This ICP will serve as the foundation for target account selection, messaging, content strategy, and sales execution.

---

## **ICP Summary (One-Liner)**

**VAN targets marketing-led B2B SaaS companies (200–500 employees) on Webflow, where the website is a core growth and credibility asset and a new marketing leader is under pressure to modernize for AI-era discoverability, performance, and growth in 2026\.**

---

## **Company Profile**

**Industry**

* Primary: B2B SaaS  
* Secondary (selective): Fintech / Financial Services (Shadow-led)

**Company Size**

* 200–500 employees (sweet spot for $200K+ engagements)  
* Enterprise buyers with meaningful marketing budgets

**Technology Stack**

* Webflow Enterprise customers (preferred)  
* Actively investing in website tooling (e.g. personalization, experimentation)  
* Marketing owns the website, not engineering

**Go-To-Market Reality**

* Website is tied to pipeline, credibility, and growth  
* Marketing teams are accountable for outcomes, not just brand

---

## **Core Buying Triggers**

### **Primary Trigger (≈80% of wins)**

**Leadership or organizational change**

* New CMO, VP Marketing, or Head of Growth  
* Immediate need for:  
  * early wins  
  * credibility with executives  
  * visible impact  
* Website becomes the fastest, lowest-risk lever to pull

### **Secondary Trigger (rising urgency)**

**AI / AEO pressure**

* Growing concern about:  
  * AI-driven discovery  
  * traffic erosion  
  * outdated site structure  
* Strong desire to future-proof the website for 2026

The combination of **personal urgency (new leader)** and **market pressure (AEO)** creates ideal buying conditions.

---

## **Buying Committee**

**Economic Buyer**

* CMO / VP Marketing / Head of Growth

**Decision Driver**

* Marketing leadership

**Approver**

* Finance

**Influencers**

* Brand / Design

**Non-Blocker**

* Engineering / IT (for existing Webflow customers)

---

## **Disqualification Criteria (Protecting Deal Quality)**

We deprioritize or exclude accounts where:

* No recent marketing leadership change  
* Website is not tied to pipeline or growth  
* Marketing lacks ownership or budget authority  
* Primary motivation is low-cost execution  
* No urgency around AI, AEO, or modernization

Discipline here protects deal size, velocity, and focus.

# **ICP Assumptions**

### **Locked ICP Assumption \#1 (Company Operating Model)**

**Marketing-led organizations**, where:

* Marketing owns the website  
* Speed, experimentation, and independence matter  
* Engineering is a support function, not the gatekeeper

This aligns *exactly* with why teams move to Webflow and why VAN wins.

### **​​Locked ICP Assumption \#2 (Industry Focus)**

**Primary ICP:**  
 ✅ **B2B SaaS / Platforms**

**Secondary (adjacent, not core for Q1):**  
 ↳ Fintech / Financial Services (Shadow-led credibility only, selectively)

This is the *right* call for Q1 because:

* You already have pattern recognition  
* You already speak the language  
* You already have proof across VAN  
* You reduce execution risk while standing up ABM

We can always **expand industries later** once the engine works.

### **Locked ICP Assumption \#3 (Buying Reality)**

For VAN’s ABM motion:

* **Marketing is the primary decision-maker and driver**  
  * CMO / VP Marketing owns the initiative

* **Finance provides final sign-off**  
  * Budget validation, not strategic veto

* **IT / Engineering is not a blocker**  
  * Especially for existing Webflow customers

* **Brand / Design may be influential**  
  * Quality, consistency, and execution matter

This is a *very favorable* setup for:

* $150k–$250k deal sizes  
* ABM-led sales motions  
* Shorter enterprise cycles

It also confirms that **Webflow-first accounts are the right starting point**, because you’ve removed the biggest enterprise friction (IT).

### **Locked ICP Assumption \#4 (Trigger & Urgency)**

For VAN, **timing matters more than fit alone**. The two dominant buying triggers are:

### **Primary trigger (≈80% of wins)**

✅ **Leadership / org change**

* New CMO, VP Marketing, or Head of Growth  
* New leader needs:  
  * early wins  
  * credibility with execs  
  * visible impact  
* Website becomes the fastest, safest lever to pull

### **Secondary trigger (rapidly rising)**

✅ **AEO / AI-era discoverability pressure**

* Marketers feel behind  
* Fear of losing traffic and relevance in 2026  
* Need to modernize site structure, content, and experimentation fast  
* This creates *defensive urgency*, not just growth ambition

This is a **very strong ABM signal combination**:

* One trigger is *personal and political* (new leader)  
* The other is *market-driven and external* (AI/AEO shift)
