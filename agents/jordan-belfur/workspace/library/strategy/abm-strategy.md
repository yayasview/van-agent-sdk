# Enterprise ABM Motion — Strategy Blueprint

*Primary Pipeline Engine for VAN Q1 2026*

---

## Objective

Build a repeatable enterprise ABM motion that generates qualified pipeline by targeting a small set of high-fit enterprise accounts with high-signal personalization. Q1 is pipeline creation (not revenue closed), while establishing the systems, assets, and cadence required to scale over the next 3-12 months.

**Q1 Pipeline Target: $1.5M qualified ABM pipeline created.**

---

## Strategic Thesis

VAN will win by becoming the digital transformation partner for enterprise marketing teams. We modernize web experiences into performance-driven growth systems — combining strategy, design, and technical execution for AI-era discoverability.

This is **not** a high-volume outbound strategy. We are not pursuing spray-and-pray outreach, mass email automation, or low-quality content production. Our strategy prioritizes high-signal personalization, credibility, and conversion over volume.

We will win by delivering hyper-personalized insights and assets that create executive trust and drive conversion through:

- Hand-picked target accounts with tiered ABM personalization (1:1 and 1:few)
- Coordinated multi-channel outreach across LinkedIn, email, and targeted advertising
- Role-specific messaging across the buying committee (marketing, finance, operations)
- Event-based content (webinars + podcast) built as deal enablement infrastructure, not general awareness
- A long-term door-opener roadmap including physical mail and executive dinners

---

## Q1 Deliverables

- A targeted enterprise ABM program focused on ~30-40 priority accounts
- Tiered ABM execution: Tier 1 (1:1) ~10 accounts, Tier 2 (1:few) ~20-30 accounts
- Coordinated outreach across LinkedIn, email, and ads
- An event-based content engine (webinars + podcast) used as deal enablement
- A weekly operating cadence to track pipeline creation and account progression

## ABM Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Define the ABM Program (Weeks 1-2)
**Status: DONE**

- Account list confirmed (~30-40 accounts), tiered (Tier 1 vs Tier 2)
- ICP filters confirmed
- ABM stages defined (simplified to 2-stage: Discovery Complete → Proposal or Holding)
- Success targets set: $1.5M qualified pipeline, meetings booked, qualified opps

**Owner:** Yaya + Collin
**Output:** Locked ABM program structure + targets + account list

### Step 2 — Build ABM Messaging + Assets (Weeks 1-3)
**Status: IN PROGRESS**

Deliverables:
- VAN ABM messaging framework: VAN pitch (short), persona messaging (CMO/VP Marketing, Head of Web, Finance), top objections + responses
- Tier 1 asset kit: account insight brief template, door-opener asset template (one-pager / teardown / mini-audit)
- Tier 2 asset kit: vertical-based messaging angles, reusable case-study snippets by pain point

**Owner:** Yaya + Collin
**Output:** Messaging system + reusable assets (Tier 1 + Tier 2)

### Step 3 — Launch Outreach Motion (Weeks 3-5)
**Status: UP NEXT**

**Outreach methodology: Teaching-First (Felix Framework, validated Feb 6)**

The outreach motion uses the AI Brand Tool report as the wedge. The approach:
1. Send AI brand report to target account as a **feedback request** ("We built this tool, ran your site through it — does this look right?")
2. Let the score/gap create natural curiosity (not a pitch — asking for advice)
3. Offer a free hands-on teaching event to fix the specific issues surfaced
4. The teaching event positions VAN as expert; attendees realize the complexity and want to hire
5. Follow up with depth — content, value, strategic conversation

Additional deliverables:
- Tier 1 outreach launched (10 accounts) — AI brand report + feedback request + teaching event invite
- Coordinated sequences live: LinkedIn cadence, email cadence, retargeting ads (lightweight, credibility-driven)
- Physical mail for Tier 1 accounts (Felix: "never forget physical mail")
- Meeting booking + handoff flow: SDR books → AE runs discovery → founders support strategic calls
- Test messaging variants for teaching events: "training session" vs. "exclusive workshop" vs. "hands-on lab"

**Owner:** SDR + AE + Yaya
**Output:** Outreach live, meetings booked weekly

### Step 4 — Event-Based Content Engine (Weeks 2-12)
**Status: KICKING OFF (Feb 13)**

Deliverables:
- Webinar program aligned to ABM objections + buyer pain: 5 webinars in Q1
- Podcast motion initiated: guest list aligned to ICP, cadence set (weekly or biweekly)
- ABM follow-up sequences tied to every event: attendee follow-up, non-attendee recap, targeted outreach referencing content

**Owner:** Collin + Yaya
**Output:** Content drives trust + meetings; events become ABM conversion catalysts

### Step 5 — Program Cadence + Optimization Loop (Weeks 3-12)
**Status: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL**

Deliverables:
- Weekly ABM operating cadence: account progression review, KPI tracking, replace stalled accounts
- Continuous iteration: update messaging, sharpen offers, improve conversion (reply → meeting → opp)

**Owner:** Yaya + Collin + AE/SDR
**Output:** ABM becomes a repeatable machine, not a one-off campaign

## Tiered Account Strategy

### Tier 1: Strategic Accounts (1:1) — 10 Accounts
**Status: FINALIZED — in HubSpot + Sales Navigator**

Fully custom, high-touch campaigns. Custom research, personalized content, executive outreach, multi-threaded engagement (2-3 contacts per account).

**Research Status:** COMPLETE — Yaya conducted comprehensive research for all Tier 1 accounts (company info, industry, news, funding, decision makers with LinkedIn + emails, individual account briefs, AI brand reports with scores).

**Tactics:**
- AI brand report sent as feedback request (teaching-first wedge)
- Deep account research (org structure, tech stack, pain signals, leadership changes) — DONE
- Custom content: account insight briefs, door-opener assets (teardown / mini-audit / one-pager)
- Executive-to-executive outreach
- Podcast door-opener motion (invite CMOs as guests)
- Hands-on teaching event invitations tied to AI brand report findings
- Physical mail for high-priority contacts
- Personalized ABM landing pages (built in Webflow, live)
- Coordinated LinkedIn + email + retargeting sequences

**Success metric:** Meetings booked with decision makers.

### Tier 2: Growth Accounts (1:Few) — 20-30 Accounts
**Status: IN PROGRESS — Cat finalizing by Feb 13**

Segment-based campaigns grouped by industry vertical or shared pain point. Vertical-based messaging angles, reusable case-study snippets.

**Tactics:**
- Segment-specific email sequences
- Targeted LinkedIn ads by account list
- Webinars (5 in Q1, 80% AEO-focused) as engagement drivers
- Curated content by segment

**Success metric:** 15-20% engagement rate, 5-8% meeting conversion.

## Proprietary Tools & Assets

### AI Brand Tool (Built Internally)
Compares how a company describes itself on its website vs. how top 3 LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) describe them. Produces a score and report. Built to bridge the gap between technical SEO audits and what marketers actually care about — "Do I show up in AEO? If so, how?"

**Reports generated for every account on the ABM list.** This is the primary outreach wedge.

### Campaign Development via AI Agents (Felix Recommendation)
Per Felix's advice, campaign strategy/creative/optimization should be developed using multiple AI agents working in parallel — not traditional consulting. Specifically:
- Use AI agents to build rational testing plans for ABM campaigns
- Create synthetic focus groups based on target audience to test campaigns before going live
- Develop live in-campaign CRO processes via AI
- AI training data contains world-class playbooks that are more comprehensive than any individual consultant's knowledge

## Messaging Architecture

### VAN Pitch (Short) — TO BE FINALIZED
Components: Who VAN is → What we do → Why now (AI-era shift) → For whom

### 5-Part Sales Narrative — TO BE FINALIZED
1. **Who VAN is** — Next-gen agency network, global creative consultancy
2. **What we do** — Digital transformation partner for enterprise marketing teams

4. **Proof points** — Case studies, outcomes, speed, conversion, delivery velocity
5. **How engagements work** — Pilot → Retainer → Expansion

### Persona-Specific Messaging — TO BE BUILT
- **CMO / VP Marketing:** Strategic partnership, outcomes, complexity reduction, early wins
- **Head of Web / Digital:** Capability depth, Webflow expertise, speed, technical execution
- **Finance / Procurement:** Vendor consolidation, budget alignment, consistent SLAs

### Top 10 Objections — TO BE BUILT

### Outreach Templates — TO BE BUILT

## Content Strategy Integration

Content is **deal enablement**, not awareness. Principle: educate before we sell.

### Webinar Engine
- 5 webinars in Q1, 80% AEO-focused
- Format: 45-60 min (POV + education → expert discussion → practical takeaways → CTA into diagnostic/audit)
- Every webinar → 2 weeks of multi-channel content + ABM follow-up kit
- Pre-webinar invites sent to target accounts, post-webinar follow-up within 48 hrs

### Podcast Door-Opener
- 20-30 min format, hosted by Collin
- Guests = CMOs and senior marketing leaders from ABM target accounts
- Invite first, pitch later. Relationship-first access to executive stakeholders.
- Each episode → clips, written snippets, "3 takeaways" post, ABM follow-up templates

### Repurposing Engine
- Every content event ships a distribution pack within 72 hours
- Content used to progress deals: credibility (early-stage), trust (mid-stage), proof (late-stage)
