## Adonis — Healthcare / Health Tech | Full-Service Rebrand + Ongoing Growth

**Relevance:** Healthcare enterprise, rebrand + development + ongoing marketing/content/SEO, multi-persona site
**Best for:** Healthcare prospects, companies selling to health systems/hospitals, ongoing partnership model, content engine builds
**Agency:** Veza Digital

**Story:** Adonis is an AI-powered healthcare revenue cycle management platform ($31M Series B) selling to health systems, hospitals, physician groups, and digital health organizations. Veza Digital partnered with Adonis on a full-service engagement: complete rebrand and Webflow development, followed by 1+ year of ongoing marketing, content, and SEO support. The site serves complex enterprise healthcare buyers across multiple personas (clinical, operational, financial) — requiring messaging that translates technical AI capabilities into clear business outcomes for each buyer type. The ongoing partnership built out a mature content engine with weekly/biweekly publishing across education, AI, denial management, and specialty topics.

**Results:**
- Full rebrand and Webflow enterprise build
- Enterprise martech integration (HubSpot CRM, VWO A/B testing, Heap analytics)
- Active content engine: weekly/biweekly blog publishing across 6+ categories
- Multi-persona site architecture (health systems, hospitals, physician groups, digital health)
- 1+ year ongoing marketing, content, and SEO partnership

**Why it matters for Dimer:** Same buyer universe (health systems, providers). Same challenge (translating clinical/technical value into enterprise sales messaging). Same engagement model (build the foundation, then stay on as growth partner). Adonis proves VAN can operate at the strategic + executional level in healthcare — exactly what Dimer's RFP demands.

## Galileo — Healthcare / Virtual Care | Migration + Vertical Consolidation

**Relevance:** Healthcare, multi-audience site architecture, vertical consolidation, campaign execution
**Best for:** Healthcare prospects with multiple buyer personas, companies needing positioning realignment, campaign-driven growth
**Agency:** Shadow Digital

**Story:** Galileo is a virtual primary care platform founded by Dr. Thomas Lee (also founder of One Medical and Epocrates), serving individuals, employers, and health plans nationwide. Shadow Digital led the migration to Webflow and provided ongoing support — working closely with Galileo's marketing team to consolidate multiple verticals into a unified site experience, realign positioning across audiences, and launch several campaigns. The site now serves three distinct buyer journeys (patients, employers, health plans) with tailored messaging, proof points, and conversion paths for each — while maintaining a cohesive brand narrative around accessible, comprehensive care.

**Results:**
- Webflow migration + ongoing partnership
- Consolidated multiple verticals into unified multi-audience architecture
- Persona-specific pages: patients, employers (40%+ engagement, 70% fewer ER visits), health plans (80+ NPS)
- Positioning realignment across all audience segments
- Multiple campaign launches across verticals
- Premium interactive design (GSAP animations, Schema.org structured data)

**Why it matters for Dimer:** Galileo had the same core challenge Dimer faces — a site that needed to speak to both patients AND enterprise buyers (employers, health plans) without diluting either message. Shadow Digital built the multi-audience architecture and stayed on to execute campaigns. Dimer needs exactly this: patient acquisition + enterprise credibility engine, unified under one brand.

## Beyond Identity — Cybersecurity | Redesign Consulting + Migration

**Results:**
- Full site redesign (consulting + build)
- CMS migration to Webflow with SEO preservation and enhancement
- Collaborative model: augmented internal team, didn't replace them

**Why it matters:** Shows VAN can work alongside an existing marketing/design team — consulting on strategy and executing the build — not just taking over. Relevant for prospects who have internal capabilities but need specialized agency support.

**Relevance:** Financial services industry, marketing independence from engineering
**Best for:** Financial services / regulated industry prospects, teams bottlenecked by engineering

**Results:**
