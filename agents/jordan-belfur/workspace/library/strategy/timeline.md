# VAN Q1 2026 — 90-Day Plan & Status Tracker

*Synced from: Q1 Strategy Memo + ClickUp (VAN Growth > VAN Global > VAN - ABM Launch)*
*Last synced: February 6, 2026*

## Where We Are

**We are in the transition between Weeks 1-2 (Foundation) and Weeks 3-5 (Launch).**

Foundation work is substantially done: ABM stages defined, pipeline model simplified, account list tiered (Tier 1 locked, Tier 2 in progress), standup cadence restructured, ABM process tested end-to-end with Imagen. The next critical gate is locking messaging and kicking off the content engine.
