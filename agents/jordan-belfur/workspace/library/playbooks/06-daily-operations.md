# Daily BDR Operations Playbook

## Purpose
Establish consistent daily and weekly routines that keep the sales pipeline healthy, priorities clear, and deals moving forward.

---

## 1. Morning Pipeline Review Routine (9 AM, 15 minutes)

### Input
- HubSpot access
- Calendar for the day
- List of deals you own

### Step 1: Check for Urgent Items (3 min)
1. Log into HubSpot
2. Look at Dashboard or Pipeline view
3. Scan for **red flags**:
   - Any deals with **close date TODAY** → Immediate action (call or email today)
   - Any deals with **close date in PAST** → Update status immediately
   - Any **overdue tasks** → What needs to be done?
   - Any **new activity from prospects in inbox** → Respond within 1 hour

**Action if red flag found**: Add to "Top 3 Today" list (see below)

### Step 2: Identify Top 3 Priorities (5 min)

Ask yourself: "What are the 3 most important things I can do today to move deals forward?"

**Criteria for prioritization**:
1. **Deal size** (biggest deals first)
2. **Deal stage** (contracts/negotiations > proposals > discovery)
3. **Urgency** (close date soonest first)
4. **Likelihood of movement** (which deal can I actually advance today?)

**Example**:
```
Top 3 Today:
1. Call ABC Corp re: contract signature (contract expires tomorrow)
2. Send revised proposal to TechCorp (due by COB today per their request)
3. Prep for 2 PM discovery call with StartupXYZ
```

### Step 3: Check Your Calendar (2 min)
1. What meetings do you have today?
2. How much time between meetings for deal work?
3. Block off time for "deal work" if calendar is packed
4. Note: Any meetings you need to prep for?

### Step 4: Review Current Deals in Active Stages (5 min)
Filter HubSpot by stage:
- **Proposal stage**: Any expiring soon? Any no response > 5 days?
- **Negotiation stage**: Any movement needed? Any stalled?
- **Contract stage**: Any unsigned > 3 days?

**Action**: If any deal needs attention, add to task list or Top 3 Today

### Output
- Written list of Top 3 priorities for day
- Calendar blocked for important deal work
- Awareness of any urgent items needing immediate response

### Quick Template
```
TODAY'S PRIORITIES — [Date]

RED FLAGS:
☐ [Urgent item 1 - what it is, action needed, by when]
☐ [Urgent item 2]

TOP 3 TODAY:
1. [Priority 1 - brief description]
2. [Priority 2 - brief description]
3. [Priority 3 - brief description]

CALENDAR:

9:15 AM-12 PM: Open for deal work
12-1 PM: Lunch
1-2 PM: [Meeting name]

```

---

## 2. Throughout the Day: Handling Activity & Responses

### Priority Response Times
- **Prospect email/message**: Respond within 2 hours (or within 4 hours if after hours)
- **Prospect phone call**: Return call same day within 4 hours
- **Manager request**: Respond within 1 hour
- **Prospect meeting request**: Respond with calendar link within 2 hours

### Activity Log as You Go
**Don't wait until end of day**. Log activities in HubSpot as they happen:

**Immediately after a call**:
1. Open deal in HubSpot
2. Click "Add activity" → "Call"
3. Log: Duration, outcome, next steps, date of follow-up

**Immediately after email sent**:
1. If email is decision-critical (proposal sent, follow-up, etc.) → Log in HubSpot

**Immediately after meeting**:
1. Draft quick meeting recap
2. Share with attendees within 2 hours
3. Log in HubSpot activity

**When task completed**:
1. Mark task as "Complete" in HubSpot
2. Create follow-up task if another action needed

### During Working Hours: Reality Check
**Every 2-3 hours**, ask:
- "Am I still on track with my Top 3 for today?"
- "Have any new urgent items come up?"
- "Are there any responses I need to send?"

---

## 3. End-of-Day Logging and Cleanup (4:30-5 PM, 20 minutes)

### Purpose
Record everything done today so:
- HubSpot is accurate for tomorrow
- Nothing falls through cracks
- You can close your laptop clean

### Step 1: Log All Activity from Today (10 min)

**Go through each deal you touched today**:
1. Did you have a call? Log it
2. Did you send email? Log the important ones (not every email, just decision-critical ones)
3. Did you send a proposal/contract? Log it
4. Did you get a response from prospect? Log it
5. Did you complete a task? Mark complete and document result

**Rule**: Every prospect interaction should be logged in HubSpot same day

**What to log**:
- Calls and meetings
- Proposals/contracts sent
- Prospect responses (feedback, objections, approvals)
- Deliverables sent
- Tasks completed

**What NOT to log**:
- Every single email (just important decisions/updates)
- Internal calls/emails (log quick internal notes separately)
- Lunch, admin work, reading articles

### Step 2: Update Deal Stages (3 min)

Check each deal in Proposal/Negotiation/Contract stage:
- Did deal progress? Move to next stage
- Did prospect response change deal? Update fields (amount, close date, etc.)
- Did deal stall? Move to "Stale" or "Lost"

### Step 3: Set Tomorrow's Tasks (4 min)

For each active deal:
- Is there a follow-up needed? Create task with due date
- Is there a meeting scheduled? Confirm it's in calendar and task list
- Is there a deliverable due? Create task with deadline

**Rule**: Every deal should have a clear next action with due date

### Step 4: Review & Cleanup (3 min)

- Close all open deals/tasks in HubSpot
- Check email for any last-minute items (if any urgent, handle now; if not, defer to tomorrow)
- Clear your desk/close tabs
- Take a moment: "What went well today? What could be better tomorrow?"

### End-of-Day Template
```

## 4. Weekly Reporting Cadence

### Weekly Pipeline Review (Every Monday, 10 AM, 30 minutes)

#### Input Required
- HubSpot pipeline report
- Last week's activity log
- Weekly quota/target

#### Review Process

**Step 1: Pipeline Health Check** (10 min)
1. Open HubSpot Pipeline dashboard
2. Count deals in each stage (Qualified Prospect, Discovery, Proposal, Negotiation, Contract, Client)
3. Calculate total pipeline value ($)
4. Check for stale deals (last activity > 14 days)
5. Compare to previous week:
   - More or fewer deals?
   - Pipeline growing or shrinking?
   - Any deals advancing to next stage?

**Action**: If pipeline is shrinking or too few active deals, escalate or increase outreach

**Step 2: Activity Metrics** (5 min)
- **Deals created this week**: [#]
- **Deals advanced to next stage**: [#]
- **Deals closed (won/lost)**: [#]
- **Proposals sent this week**: [#]
- **Meetings held this week**: [#]
- **Emails sent this week**: [#] (approximate)

**What this tells you**:
- Are you creating enough new deals?
- Are you advancing deals at good pace?
- Are you closing deals?
- Is activity consistent?

**Action**: If any metric is low, identify why and adjust approach

**Step 3: Deal-by-Deal Review** (10 min)

For each deal in Proposal/Negotiation/Contract stage:
- "What's the status?"
- "When did we last hear from them?"
- "What's the next step?"
- "What could get this unstuck?"

**Action**: For deals stalled > 7 days, plan specific action (call, email, meeting request)

**Step 4: Wins & Losses** (3 min)
- What deals closed this week?
  - If won: What made it happen? Any patterns?
  - If lost: Why? What could we have done differently?

**Step 5: Plan for Next Week** (2 min)
- Based on current pipeline, what's likely to close next week?
- What actions need to happen to keep deals on track?
- What new activities need to be scheduled?

### Monthly Deal Review (Last Friday of Month, 30 minutes)

#### Purpose
Assess monthly performance and plan for next month

#### Review Items
1. **Monthly wins**: Which deals closed? Total closed value? % of target achieved?
2. **Win rate**: # closed won / (# closed won + # closed lost)
3. **Sales cycle**: Average days from Qualified Prospect to Client
4. **New business created**: How much pipeline created this month?
5. **Trending deals**: What's likely to close next month?
6. **Performance vs. quota**: How are you tracking against monthly/quarterly goals?

#### If Missing Quota
- Identify: Where's the gap? (Not enough new deals? Too long sales cycle? Too many losses?)
- Plan: What's the action plan to catch up next month?
- Escalate: Do you need help/resources from manager?

## 5. How to Handle Ad-Hoc Requests

### Ad-Hoc Request Definition
Unexpected request from manager, project team, or client (not in your scheduled priorities)

### Decision Tree: Accept or Defer?

```
→ Is it from manager, client, or internal team?
│
├─ MANAGER REQUEST:
│  └─ "How urgent?" (ask if not clear)
│     ├─ Urgent (today): Drop current task, do it now
│     ├─ This week: Schedule specific time, confirm deadline
│     └─ Next week: Add to list, confirm you'll do by when
│
├─ CLIENT REQUEST (prospect or active client):
│  └─ "How time-sensitive?"
│     ├─ Impacts deal close: Priority over internal work
│     ├─ Needs response today: Respond with timeline, "will have by [time]"
│     └─ Can wait: Confirm timeline, schedule accordingly
│
└─ INTERNAL TEAM REQUEST (not manager):
   └─ "Is this my responsibility?"
      ├─ YES (part of my job): "When do you need it? I can do [timeline]"
      └─ NO (not my job): Politely redirect to right person, offer to help
```

### How to Handle (Template)

**When request comes in**:
1. **Clarify**: "I want to help—when do you need this?" or "What's the timeline?"
2. **Assess impact**: "I'm currently working on [Top 3 Today]. I can do this by [time] or [alternative time]—what works?"
3. **Confirm**: Once timeline agreed, add to task list with due date
4. **Execute**: Do the work by agreed deadline
5. **Update**: Let requester know it's done

**If you can't fit it in**:
- "I'd love to help, but I'm deep in [deal work]. Can this wait until [time], or should I ask [person] to help?"
- Don't agree to unrealistic timelines

### Common Ad-Hoc Requests & Responses

**Request**: "Can you pull a report on [something]?"
**Response**: "Sure! I can have that to you by [COB today / tomorrow morning]. Will that work?"

**Request**: "Need to schedule a meeting with [client] ASAP"
**Response**: "I'll reach out to them right now. What times work for you?"

**Request**: "Client is asking about [proposal detail]"
**Response**: "On it. I'll get you a response by [time]."

**Request**: "Can you write copy for [marketing material]?"
**Response**: "That's great, but that's typically [other person/team]'s area. Want me to loop them in, or do you need me to write it?" (Know your boundaries)

---

## 6. Managing Your Time & Workload

### Time Allocation Target (Per Week)
- **Deal work** (calls, meetings, emails): 60%
- **Follow-ups & pipeline reviews**: 20%
- **Admin/reporting**: 10%
- **Learning/professional development**: 10%

### Blocking Time on Calendar
Schedule these blocks on your calendar to protect deal work time:

**Daily**:
- 9-9:15 AM: Pipeline review (calendar block: "Morning Pipeline Review")
- 4:30-5 PM: End-of-day logging (calendar block: "Daily Close-out")

**Weekly**:
- Monday 10 AM: Weekly pipeline review (30 min)
- Friday 4 PM: Weekly reflection + planning (15 min)

**Monthly**:
- Last Friday 2 PM: Monthly review (30 min)

This prevents others from booking over your critical processes.

### Avoiding Burnout
- **End-of-day rule**: Close HubSpot/email at 5:30 PM; don't work after hours (except emergencies)
- **One day off per week**: You need downtime to recharge
- **Stay organized**: Organized people are less stressed
- **Ask for help**: If pipeline is too big, tell your manager

---

## 7. Communication Preferences & Logistics

### How to Be Reachable
- **Email**: Check 3x daily (9 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM) + respond to urgent within 2 hours
- **Phone**: Keep phone nearby during work hours; return calls same day
- **Slack/Teams**: Check every hour if using; turn off notifications after 5:30 PM
- **Calendar**: Keep accurate; people should be able to find open times

### Out of Office
- **If taking day off**: Set auto-responder: "I'm out today. For urgent matters, contact [Manager]. I'll respond to you on [return date]."
- **If out for extended time**: Assign coverage to teammate; brief them on active deals
- **Before leaving**: Brief manager on all hot deals + timeline for responses

### Escalation Path (If You're Stuck)
1. **Ask yourself**: "Can I solve this myself?" (Try first)
2. **Ask your manager**: "I'm stuck on [issue]. Here's what I've tried. What should I do?"
3. **Don't spiral**: If you've asked for help, trust the advice and move forward

## 10. Decision Workflows for Daily Questions

### "Should I contact this prospect again?"

```
→ When did we last contact them?
├─ < 3 days ago: Probably not yet (unless they asked for something specific)
├─ 3-7 days ago: Depends on deal stage
│  ├─ Proposal stage: Send check-in
│  ├─ Negotiation stage: Call if needed
│  └─ Discovery: Email is fine
└─ > 7 days ago: Send follow-up ASAP (see 03-follow-ups.md)
```

### "Should I move this deal to next stage?"

```
→ Deal stage?
├─ Qualified Prospect → Discovery:
│  └─ Criteria met? (1st meeting scheduled/held, interest expressed)
│     ├─ YES: Move it
│     └─ NO: Keep in current stage
├─ Discovery → Proposal:
│  └─ Criteria met? (discovery call completed, needs documented)
│     ├─ YES: Move it
│     └─ NO: Keep in current stage
├─ Proposal → Negotiation:
│  └─ Criteria met? (prospect gave feedback, engaged discussion)
│     ├─ YES: Move it
│     └─ NO: Keep in current stage; might move back to Discovery
└─ [etc for other stages]
```

### "Should I close this deal as Lost?"

```
→ Why would we close it?
├─ Prospect explicitly said "No" or going elsewhere: CLOSE as Lost immediately
├─ No response for > 14 days: Send 1 final check-in; if no response, CLOSE as Lost
├─ Not a fit (wrong budget, wrong timeline, wrong need): CLOSE as Lost
├─ They said "Maybe later" and that timeframe has passed: CLOSE as Lost
└─ Stalled > 30 days with no clarity: ESCALATE to manager; let them decide
```

## 11. When Things Go Wrong: Troubleshooting

### Problem: I'm Behind on My Quota

**Diagnosis**:
1. Is it a volume problem? (Not enough new deals?)
2. Is it a velocity problem? (Deals taking too long to close?)
3. Is it a loss problem? (Losing too many deals?)

**Action**:
- **Volume**: Increase outreach, ask manager for leads
- **Velocity**: Review stalled deals, move stuck deals forward
- **Loss**: Ask manager to help you understand why you're losing; adjust approach

### Problem: A Deal Stalled & I Don't Know Why

**Action**:
1. Review all deal notes and activity
2. Call prospect: "Hi [Name], just checking in. I want to make sure we're still aligned on [project]. Where are you at with [next step]?"
3. Listen for concern/objection
4. Address it directly or escalate to manager

### Problem: A Prospect is Unhappy

**Action**:
1. **Listen**: Let them vent; don't interrupt
2. **Acknowledge**: "I understand your concern about [issue]."
3. **Solve**: "Here's what we can do..." OR "Let me connect you with [person] who can help"
4. **Follow up**: Check in 24-48 hours: "How is that working better for you?"
5. **Escalate if needed**: If you can't solve it, involve manager/project lead

### Problem: My Manager Keeps Changing My Priorities

**Action**:
1. **At next 1:1**: "I want to make sure I'm focused on the right things. Can we align on my top 3 priorities this week?"
2. **Get it in writing**: "So this week I'm focused on [A], [B], [C]. Is that right?"
3. **Check weekly**: "Still good on my priorities, or do I need to adjust?"
