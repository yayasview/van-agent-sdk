# {{client_company}} | {{project_type}}

> **Template Type:** One-Time Project Proposal (Migration, Build, Redesign)
> **Companion Document:** This proposal is paired with a separate Statement of Work (SOW) that contains the detailed scope, deliverables, hour breakdowns, payment schedule, and legal terms.
> **Usage:** This is the strategic "sell" document. It answers: Why this project? Why now? Why VAN? What will the business gain? Everything here should be framed around business outcomes, not technical deliverables.

## Cover Page

**{{client_company}} | {{project_type}}**

**{{tagline}}**

| Prepared for | Prepared by |
|---|---|
| {{client_contact_name}} | {{agency_contact_name}} |
| {{client_company}} | VAN |

> **BDR Instructions:** Write a one-line tagline that captures the strategic outcome of this project — not a description of what we're building.
>
> Good:
> - "Giving Kooth's marketing team full control of their stakeholder experience"
> - "Turning TabaPay's website into their highest-converting sales channel"
> - "Building the digital foundation for Zocks' next phase of growth"
>
> Bad:
> - "Webflow Migration for connect.kooth.com" (that's a task description)
> - "Website Redesign and Development" (generic, says nothing about value)

## 1. The Opportunity

{{the_opportunity}}

> **BDR Instructions:** This replaces the traditional "Executive Summary." Do NOT describe what we're building. Describe the business moment the client is in and why this project matters RIGHT NOW.
>
> Structure (3-4 paragraphs):
>
> 1. **Context** — What's happening in their business? New leadership? Growth phase? Competitive pressure? Platform migration? Start from THEIR world, not ours.
> 2. **The gap** — What's the disconnect between where they are and where they need to be? Be specific. "Your current site requires engineering tickets for every content update, costing your team 2-3 weeks per campaign launch" > "Your website needs improvement."
> 3. **The cost of inaction** — What happens if they don't act? Lost time, continued engineering dependency, missed pipeline, brand erosion in AI search, falling behind competitors who've already modernized. Don't be dramatic — be factual.
> 4. **The vision** — In 1-2 sentences, paint the picture of success. "A site your marketing team owns end-to-end, that converts visitors into pipeline, and represents your brand accurately across every channel — including AI."
>
> Pull from: meeting notes, discovery calls, account research, AEO analysis.
> Every sentence should make the client think "they understand our situation."

---

## 2. Expected Outcomes

{{expected_outcomes}}

> **BDR Instructions:** This is the core value section. List 5-7 specific, measurable business outcomes this project will deliver. These are NOT deliverables (those live in the SOW). These are the results the client actually cares about.
>
> Format each as: **Outcome statement** — 1 sentence of supporting context.
>
> Good outcomes:
> - **Marketing team independence** — Your team will manage ~80% of site updates without engineering tickets, reducing content update cycles from weeks to hours.
> - **AI discoverability** — Your brand will surface accurately across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini, closing the gap between how you describe yourself and how AI describes you.
> - **Performance baseline** — 90+ Lighthouse scores across all pages, ensuring fast load times and strong organic search signals from day one.
> - **Unified platform** — One Webflow workspace for both properties, simplifying maintenance, reducing vendor costs, and enabling cross-site consistency.
> - **Scalable content engine** — CMS architecture that lets you publish new case studies, resources, and blog posts without developer involvement.
> - **Protected search equity** — Full redirect mapping and SEO implementation so you don't lose the organic traffic you've already earned.
> - **Reduced time-to-market** — Campaign landing pages go from a 3-week dev cycle to same-day publishing by your marketing team.
>
> Bad outcomes:
> - "50 pages built in Webflow" (that's a deliverable, not an outcome)
> - "Better website" (meaningless)
> - "SEO improvements" (not specific enough)
>
> Tie each outcome back to something the client said in discovery. The best proposals feel like a mirror — the client sees their own priorities reflected back.

## 3. Our Approach

{{our_approach}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Describe HOW we'll achieve the outcomes — at a strategy/methodology level, not a task level. Detailed deliverables live in the SOW. This section communicates confidence and process.
>
> Structure:
>
> 1. **Philosophy** (1-2 sentences) — How VAN approaches this type of work. Example: "We work in gated phases — each one building on the last, each one requiring your sign-off before we move forward. Nothing gets built that you haven't approved, and nothing gets approved that doesn't map back to your business goals."
>
> 2. **Key phases** (3-5 bullets) — Describe phases in terms of what the client will EXPERIENCE, not what the dev team will do internally:
>    - "We start by aligning on the pages, content structures, and priorities that matter most — so we're building the right things, not just building things."
>    - "You'll see your core pages in a live staging environment within the first few weeks, giving you something real to react to early."
>    - "Content migration happens in parallel with development, so nothing gets lost and everything carries over intact."
>    - "Before launch, we run a full quality pass across every browser and device, then hand you the keys with training and support built in."
>    - NOT: "Sprint 1: Webflow project setup, design tokens, component library scaffolding, CMS collection schema design."
>
> 3. **Client involvement** (1-2 sentences) — What we need from them and when. "We'll need your team engaged at key approval gates — typically 2-3 touchpoints per phase. Between gates, we execute. You don't need to manage us."
>
> 4. **Quality gates** — Mention that every phase requires their approval before the next begins. This signals professionalism and reduces risk.
>
> Keep this section to ~1 page. Don't turn it into a scope of work.

---

## 4. Timeline

**Estimated duration:** ~{{total_weeks}} weeks

{{timeline_overview}}

> **BDR Instructions:** High-level milestone timeline. Focus on what the client will SEE at each stage, not what happens behind the scenes.
>
> | Milestone | Timing | What You'll See |
> |-----------|--------|-----------------|
> | Kickoff & Alignment | Week 1-2 | Finalized sitemap, confirmed priorities, project plan locked |
> | First Pages in Staging | Week 3-4 | Core pages viewable in a live staging environment, CMS structure built |
> | Full Site in Staging | Week 6-8 | All pages built, content migrated, SEO implemented |
> | Launch | Week 10 | Live site, DNS cutover, monitoring active |
> | Handoff & Support | Week 11-12 | Training complete, team enabled, support window active |
>
> **Rules:**
> - No specific calendar dates. Use "Week X" format only.
> - Always include: "Timeline assumes timely client feedback at each milestone. Delays in approvals will shift subsequent phases accordingly."
> - Keep it simple — 5-6 rows max. The detailed phase plan with approval gates lives in the SOW.

## 5. Investment

{{investment_framing}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Open with a 1-2 sentence value anchor BEFORE showing numbers. Remind them what they're getting.
>
> Example: "This investment covers the complete migration, CMS architecture, SEO foundation, AI discoverability optimization, team training, and 2 weeks of post-launch support — everything needed to get your marketing team fully operational on a platform they own."

| Workstream | Investment |
|------------|-----------|
| {{workstream_1}} | ${{amount_1}} |
| {{workstream_2}} | ${{amount_2}} |
| {{workstream_3}} | ${{amount_3}} |
| **Total Investment** | **${{total_cost}}** |

> **BDR Instructions:** Show workstream-level pricing, NOT hour-by-hour breakdowns. The client cares about what they're paying for at a category level. Detailed hours and rates live in the SOW.
>
> Good workstream labels:
> - "Webflow Development & Build" ($37,500)
> - "Content Migration & CMS Architecture" ($3,600)
> - "Technical SEO & AI Discoverability" ($1,800)
> - "Quality Assurance & Launch" ($2,400)
> - "Project Management" ($6,000)
>
> Bad workstream labels:
> - "250 hours x $150/hr" (too granular for the proposal — save for SOW)

### Included at No Additional Cost

{{included_bonuses}}

> **BDR Instructions:** List bonuses with their standalone value. This reinforces the deal:
>
> - **WAIO Implementation** (Valued at $5,000) — AI discoverability optimization to ensure your brand surfaces accurately across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini.
> - **Training & Enablement Program** (Valued at $2,400) — Hands-on CMS training, content workflow setup, and component library walkthrough so your team is self-sufficient post-launch.
> - **Post-Launch Support — 2 Weeks** (Valued at $4,200) — Full team availability for bug fixes, feedback, and transition support during the critical post-launch window.
>
> Close with: "That's ${{bonus_value}} in additional value included with this engagement."

### Payment Structure

{{payment_structure}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Keep this simple. Show the milestone-based split:
>
> | Milestone | Percentage |
> |-----------|-----------|
> | At signing | 50% |
> | Net-30 post kickoff | 40% |
> | At project handoff | 10% |
>
> If the client needs exact dollar amounts in the proposal, include them. Otherwise, default to percentages here and put exact figures in the SOW.

## 6. Why VAN

{{why_van}}

> **BDR Instructions:** 4-5 proof points. Don't list generic capabilities — prove specific relevance to THIS client and THIS project. Structure each as:
>
> **[Proof Point]** — [1-2 sentence explanation with evidence]
>
> Good:
> - **Deep Webflow specialization** — We're a certified Webflow Enterprise partner with 50+ enterprise builds. This isn't a side offering — it's our core.
> - **We've done this exact migration before** — We migrated [similar company] from [platform] to Webflow in [X weeks], with zero downtime and a 40% improvement in page speed.
> - **Enablement-first approach** — Every engagement ends with your team trained and independent. We don't create dependency — we build capability.
> - **AI discoverability expertise** — Our WAIO framework is purpose-built to ensure your brand shows up accurately across AI search platforms, not just Google.
> - **Part of VAN** — Access to a full network of specialists across brand, SEO, performance marketing, and strategy. One partner, full stack.
>
> Bad:
> - "We're a great team of passionate designers" (generic, no proof)
> - "We use agile methodology" (so does everyone)
>
> If we have a relevant case study, reference it. If we've worked in their industry, say so.

---

## 7. Select Case Studies

{{case_studies}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Include 2-3 case studies that mirror the prospect's situation. Pull from `library/strategy/case-studies.md` and match on:
>
> - **Industry proximity** — Financial services? Lead with Sterling Bank or Mizuho. Fintech? Lead with Bench.
> - **Project similarity** — Large content migration? Bench (1,000+ pages). Tight timeline? TSIA (6 weeks). Marketing independence? Sterling Bank.
> - **Pain match** — Engineering bottleneck? Sterling Bank. SEO risk during migration? TSIA. Content scale? Bench.
>
> Format each case study as:
>
> **Company Name** — *Industry | Project Type*
> 3-4 sentence story covering: what they came to us with, what we did, and measurable results. End with the outcome that matches this prospect's situation.
>
> Rules:
> - Keep each to 3-4 sentences max. This is proof, not a portfolio deck.
> - Always include at least one hard metric (pages migrated, speed improvement, keyword growth, etc.)
> - If you have a testimonial quote, use it — social proof > our own claims.
> - The last case study should mirror the prospect's exact situation (same industry or same pain point).

## 8. Next Steps

{{next_steps}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Clear, simple, low-friction. 3-4 steps max:
>
> 1. Review this proposal and the accompanying Statement of Work
> 2. Schedule a walkthrough to discuss questions and align on priorities
> 3. Sign the SOW and submit the first payment to lock in the engagement
> 4. Kickoff call within 1 week of signing
>
> Close with: "We're ready to move when you are. [Contact name] is available at [email] if you'd like to discuss anything before the walkthrough."
>
> The goal: make saying "yes" feel easy and safe. No pressure, just clarity.
