{{project_type}} — {{engagement_phase}}

Prepared: {{date}} | Author: {{author}} | Classification: Internal Only

## 1. Client & Contacts

| Field | Detail |
|:------|:-------|
| **Client** | {{client_company}} |
| **Industry** | {{client_industry}} |
| **Website** | {{client_website}} |
| **Relationship** | {{relationship_context}} |

> **BDR Instructions for Relationship:** State whether this is a new client or returning. If returning, describe the history in one line. Examples:
> - "New client. Inbound via Webflow partner referral."
> - "Returning client. Shadow built their original Webflow site in 2024. This is a new engagement extending the existing platform."

### Client Contacts

| Name | Role | Email | Decision Authority |
|------|------|-------|--------------------|
| {{contact_1_name}} | {{contact_1_role}} | {{contact_1_email}} | {{contact_1_authority}} |
| {{contact_2_name}} | {{contact_2_role}} | {{contact_2_email}} | {{contact_2_authority}} |

> **BDR Instructions:** Decision Authority should be one of: **Decision Maker**, **Day-to-Day Lead**, **Champion**, **Influencer**, **Signer**, or **Periodic Involvement**. Always clarify who the PM's primary point of contact is.

### Internal Team

| Role | Assigned |
|------|----------|
| Sales / Strategic Lead | {{sales_lead}} |
| Account Manager / PM | {{pm_name}} |
| Tech Lead (Webflow) | {{tech_lead}} |
| SEO / WAIO Lead | {{seo_lead}} |
| Additional | {{additional_team}} |

> **BDR Instructions:** If team assignments aren't confirmed yet, mark as **TBD** — but flag this as an immediate action item in Section 10.

---

## 2. Client Mindset & Working Style

{{client_mindset}}

> **BDR Instructions:** This section is critical. It tells the PM how to work with this client — not just what to build. Pull from meeting notes, email tone, and sales interactions. Cover:
>
> **Who is this person?** What's their background? Are they technical, creative, operator-driven?
>
> **What do they value?** Speed? Data? Design? Control? Collaboration?
>
> **What will frustrate them?** Slow responses? Generic recommendations? Over-engineering?
>
> **What should the PM expect?** Strong opinions? Hands-off? Micromanagement?
>
> Example (from Windows USA brief):
> - Dan is a former agency owner and HubSpot partner
> - Highly operator-driven, conversion- and economics-focused
> - Strong opinions, but collaborative
> - Not interested in "pretty redesigns" without data
> - Expects: proactive recommendations, clear prioritization, velocity with accountability, strategic thinking beyond tickets

---

## 3. Project Overview & Objectives

### Background

{{project_background}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Write 2-3 paragraphs covering:
> - What is the client trying to achieve at a business level?
> - Why now? What's the trigger for this engagement?
> - What does their current setup look like and what's broken?
> - How does this project fit into their broader strategy?

### Core Objectives (Prioritized)

{{core_objectives}}

> **BDR Instructions:** List 4-6 objectives in priority order. These should be pulled directly from discovery calls and proposal. Be specific — not "improve the website" but "improve conversion performance on service pages to reduce dependency on third-party lead marketplaces."

### Internal North Star

> {{north_star}}

> **BDR Instructions:** One sentence that captures the strategic outcome. This is the "why behind the why" — the thing the PM should keep in mind when making every decision. Examples:
> - "Help Windows USA become their own lead aggregator and reduce dependency on third parties."
> - "Turn Earned's Learn Center into a category-defining content destination."
> - "Build a site that can scale content volume and markets over 12-18 months without another rebuild."

---

## 4. Scope of Work

### In Scope

{{in_scope_details}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Pull directly from the signed proposal. Organize by workstream. Standard workstreams:
>
> **Webflow Development**
> - List all specific deliverables, pages, templates, components
> - Note which are net-new vs. existing template reuse
> - Call out any animation/interaction requirements
>
> **CMS Setup & Content Migration** (if applicable)
> - CMS collections and structure
> - Content being imported
> - Relationships and metadata to preserve
>
> **SEO / WAIO** (if applicable)
> - On-page SEO tasks
> - WAIO implementation scope
> - Schema and structured data
>
> **Training & Enablement** (if applicable)
> - What's being trained
> - When it starts
> - Goal: what should the client be able to do independently post-launch?
>
> **Post-Launch Support**
> - Duration (standard + any bonus weeks)
> - What's covered

### Explicitly Out of Scope

{{out_of_scope}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Be very explicit here. This protects the team from scope creep. List every item that was discussed but NOT included. For each, note whether it's:
> - A **Phase 2** opportunity (upsell)
> - A **separate engagement** entirely
> - Something the **client is handling internally**
>
> Example:
> - ❌ Full redesign — this is a performance facelift, not a visual overhaul
> - ❌ Content writing — client provides all copy
> - ❌ AI agent build — we support integration on Webflow side only
> - ❌ Ongoing SEO program — separate retainer engagement

>
> | Phase | Weeks | Focus |
> |-------|-------|-------|
> | Kickoff & Setup | 1-2 | SEO audit, sitemap confirmation, CMS schema, project setup |

---

## 7. Technical Notes

{{technical_notes}}

> **BDR Instructions:** This is for the dev team. Include anything that affects how they build:
> - Existing Webflow project details (do we have access? who built it?)
> - Reusable templates or components from previous work
> - CMS architecture requirements (what collections, what relationships, future-proofing)
> - Animation/interaction requirements with specifics
> - Third-party integrations (HubSpot, analytics, forms, APIs)
> - Any client-side technical constraints or preferences
> - Platform decisions (Webflow hosting tier, Enterprise, etc.)

---

## 8. Risks & Watch Items

### Risks

{{risks}}

> **BDR Instructions:** List 3-5 specific risks. For each, state the risk AND what the PM should do about it. Examples:
>
> - **Content readiness:** Learning journey tracks were still being finalized at offsite. Content delays could compress timeline. → Get content delivery dates locked at kickoff.
> - **Scope creep:** Support plan model is flexible, but budget is fixed at $10K. → Track hours closely, flag early if landing page animations eat more capacity than planned.
> - **Stakeholder impatience:** Client expects quick wins. → Bias toward visible momentum early — don't spend 3 weeks on invisible backend work.

### Assumptions

{{assumptions}}

> **BDR Instructions:** State what we're assuming to be true. If these turn out to be wrong, scope changes. Examples:
> - Client provides final designs in a timely manner
> - Net-new pages or templates post-kickoff are treated as change orders
> - Client team participates in training and owns Webflow adoption post-launch

---

## 10. Upsell & Future Opportunities

{{future_opportunities}}

> **BDR Instructions:** This section is for the PM/AM to know what's on the horizon. List anything the client mentioned that isn't in this SOW but could become a future engagement. For each, note:
> - What it is
> - How interested the client seemed
> - When it might be relevant (post-launch? Q3? next year?)
> - Any estimates or pricing already discussed
>
> Examples:
> - **Ongoing SEO retainer** — client asked about packaged deal for SEO/AEO + content. Revisit during support period.
> - **Additional websites** — client has two sister brands that need similar builds. Estimated ~50h each reusing templates.
> - **Phase 2 features** — advanced filtering, series templates, AI content workflows. Likely upsell once Phase 1 launches.

---

## 11. First 30 Days — Success Criteria

{{success_criteria}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Define what "good" looks like after the first month. This gives the PM a concrete target and prevents drift. Examples:
>
> By Day 30, we should have:
> - Noticeable performance & speed improvements
> - Clear conversion improvements on key pages
> - At least 1-2 high-performing landing page templates built
> - WAIO framework implemented on priority pages
> - Client relationship feeling strong — responsive, collaborative, no surprises
> - Clear roadmap for remaining sprints documented and shared with client
> - Hours tracking on pace (not burning through budget early)

---

## 12. Immediate Next Steps

{{next_steps}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Numbered list of specific actions the project team needs to take in the first 48-72 hours. Standard items:
>
> 1. Assign AM/PM and dev team (if not already done)
> 2. Schedule internal kickoff to review existing assets, templates, and CMS
> 3. Schedule external kickoff with client to align on content delivery, design handoff, and communication cadence
> 4. Confirm access to client's Webflow workspace, design files, and any third-party tools
> 5. Set up project tracking (hours, milestones, revision count)
> 6. Identify the highest-complexity deliverable and start there
> 7. Document any open questions that need answers before sprint 1 begins
