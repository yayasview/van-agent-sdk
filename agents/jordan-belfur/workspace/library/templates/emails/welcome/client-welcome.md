# Client Welcome Email

> **Template Type:** Post-signature welcome email
> **Trigger:** Contract/proposal signed in PandaDoc
> **Sent by:** Yaya (or sales lead who closed the deal)
> **Purpose:** Confirm the engagement, introduce the project team, set expectations for kickoff, and give the client something actionable to do before kickoff.

---

## Subject Line

`Welcome to {{agency_name}}, {{client_company}}! Next Steps Inside`

> **BDR Instructions:** Keep the subject short and scannable. The client will forward this internally — it needs to read well in an inbox. Alternative subject lines:
> - `{{client_company}} x {{agency_name}} — Welcome & Next Steps`
> - `We're live! Here's what happens next, {{client_contact_first_name}}`

## Email Body

Hi {{client_contact_names}},

Excited to officially kick things off with you. The signed agreement is attached for your records.

I'm handing things over to our project team now — you'll be hearing from **{{project_lead_name}}**, your dedicated {{project_lead_role}}, within the next 24 hours to get your kickoff scheduled.

In the meantime, here are a couple of things that will help us hit the ground running:

1. **Brand & design assets** — logos, fonts, brand guidelines, or any style references you'd like us to work from
2. **Platform access** — {{access_list}}
3. **Key stakeholders** — if there's anyone else on your team who should be included in project communications, let us know and we'll loop them in

We'll cover everything in detail during kickoff, but getting a head start on the above means we can move faster from day one.

Welcome to {{agency_name}} — looking forward to building something great together.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

## CC Line

> **BDR Instructions:** Always CC the project lead / account manager so the client sees the handoff happening in real time. This builds confidence.

CC: {{project_lead_name}} <{{project_lead_email}}>

## Tone & Style Notes

> **For BDR agent use.**

- **Keep it short.** This is not a sales email — the deal is closed. Respect their time.
- **Confident, not gushy.** One line of enthusiasm is enough. Don't over-celebrate.
- **Actionable.** Give them something specific to do. Clients appreciate feeling like things are already moving.
- **Name the PM.** Never say "our team will reach out" without a name. Anonymity erodes trust.
- **No jargon.** Don't mention internal processes, ticket systems, or tooling. Keep it client-facing.
