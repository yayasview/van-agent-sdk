## Key Decisions & Context

Important decisions, strategy shifts, lessons learned.

- **2026-02-18**: Jordan deployed on OpenClaw. ABM motion targeting 42 accounts (8 T1, 34 T2).
- **2026-02-18**: Teaching-first (Felix Framework) confirmed as core outreach methodology. Lead with AI brand tool reports, not pitches.
- **2026-02-18**: All executive outreach must be reviewed by Yaya before sending.
- **2026-02-18**: Pipeline targets Q1: $1.5M qualified pipeline, 5 teaching events, 20 WAIO implementations.
- **2026-02-23**: LinkedIn outreach playbook established. 8 messages sent across 5 T1 accounts (EventsAir, Gloo, Rootly, Siro, Zocks). Drew DiMarino (Zocks CRO) flagged as priority lead — 4-msg strategic sequence with fintech portfolio reveal in Msg 4.
- **2026-02-23**: FIRST REPLY — Alex Urquhart (EventsAir, Growth Marketing Manager) responded to Msg 1, looking to schedule a call. Rapport-first approach (commented on his old posts + DIY event hook) converted on first touch. Brianne Shaw (Gloo) replied "Not at this time" — closed.

## People & Relationships

| Who | Role | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Yaya (Yannick Lorenz) | CGO | Strategy lead, approves all exec outreach, owns sales narrative |
| Collin Belt | VP of Growth | Content engine, campaigns, podcast, outreach execution |
| Stefan Katanic | CEO | Final approvals, budget sign-off |
| Cat Cordova | Team | Account list support, Tier 2 research |

## Operating Cadence

- **ABM Stand-Up**: Tue/Thu/Fri 2:30-3:00 PM ET (Yaya + Collin)
- **Stand-up rule**: "Move or replace" — every account must show forward motion or get swapped

---

## Lessons Learned

- **2026-02-23**: Rapport-first messages outperform generic AEO asks. Alex Urquhart (personal hook about his old posts) converted on first touch. Brianne Shaw (generic "this might be random") got shut down immediately. When there's ANY thread to pull on — a post, a life event, shared interest — go personal first, business second.
- **2026-02-23**: Yaya's outreach style is warmer and simpler than initial drafts. He cuts anything that sounds performative ("genuinely impressive", "sharp moves"). Keep messages shorter, more conversational. End with questions, not statements.
- **2026-02-23**: For priority leads, layer reveals across messages — don't front-load everything. Drew DiMarino sequence: genuine (Msg 1) → relevant (Msg 2) → specific (Msg 3) → credible (Msg 4). Each message earns the right to send the next.
- **2026-02-23**: VAN fintech portfolio is a strong differentiator — Bench, Earned, Flinks, Mizuho Bank. Save it for later in the sequence as a credibility bomb, don't lead with it.
- **2026-02-23**: Veza Talks podcast is a parallel ABM channel. Get prospects on the pod to build relationships. Target "hype men" / evangelists / content-forward people at Tier 1 accounts — they say yes to podcasts easily and open doors to decision-makers.
