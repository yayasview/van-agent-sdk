## Key Decisions & Context

Important decisions, strategy shifts, lessons learned.

- **2026-02-18**: Jordan deployed on OpenClaw. ABM motion targeting 42 accounts (8 T1, 34 T2).
- **2026-02-18**: Teaching-first (Felix Framework) confirmed as core outreach methodology. Lead with AI brand tool reports, not pitches.
- **2026-02-18**: All executive outreach must be reviewed by Yaya before sending.
- **2026-02-18**: Pipeline targets Q1: $1.5M qualified pipeline, 5 teaching events, 20 WAIO implementations.
- **2026-02-23**: LinkedIn outreach playbook established. 8 messages sent across 5 T1 accounts (EventsAir, Gloo, Rootly, Siro, Zocks). Drew DiMarino (Zocks CRO) flagged as priority lead — 4-msg strategic sequence with fintech portfolio reveal in Msg 4.
- **2026-02-23**: FIRST REPLY — Alex Urquhart (EventsAir, Growth Marketing Manager) responded to Msg 1, looking to schedule a call. Rapport-first approach (commented on his old posts + DIY event hook) converted on first touch. Brianne Shaw (Gloo) replied "Not at this time" — closed.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **2026-02-23**: Rapport-first messages outperform generic AEO asks. Alex Urquhart (personal hook about his old posts) converted on first touch. Brianne Shaw (generic "this might be random") got shut down immediately. When there's ANY thread to pull on — a post, a life event, shared interest — go personal first, business second.
- **2026-02-23**: Yaya's outreach style is warmer and simpler than initial drafts. He cuts anything that sounds performative ("genuinely impressive", "sharp moves"). Keep messages shorter, more conversational. End with questions, not statements.
- **2026-02-23**: For priority leads, layer reveals across messages — don't front-load everything. Drew DiMarino sequence: genuine (Msg 1) → relevant (Msg 2) → specific (Msg 3) → credible (Msg 4). Each message earns the right to send the next.
- **2026-02-23**: VAN fintech portfolio is a strong differentiator — Bench, Earned, Flinks, Mizuho Bank. Save it for later in the sequence as a credibility bomb, don't lead with it.
- **2026-02-23**: Veza Talks podcast is a parallel ABM channel. Get prospects on the pod to build relationships. Target "hype men" / evangelists / content-forward people at Tier 1 accounts — they say yes to podcasts easily and open doors to decision-makers.
- **2026-02-25**: CapGrow Partners proposal workflow completed. Full session documented in `memory/2026-02-25-capgrow-proposal.md`. Key learnings: scope with xlsx first (not guesswork), use scope-definition-matrix labels for client-facing deliverables, fold essentials into core package (not a la carte), always do sales self-review before finalizing, case studies close deals.
- **2026-02-25**: Proposal workflow fully documented in cross-session memory. 8-step process from deal context → branded docx → Google Drive. Reusable for Sofar Ocean, Dimer Health, and all future deals.
- **2026-02-25**: Shadow Digital case study library created at `library/strategy/case-studies.md` — Bench, TSIA, Sterling Bank, Mizuho Bank with metrics, stories, and matching guide.
- **2026-02-25**: DOCX generation with python-docx works well. Shadow branding: red #E8422F, dark #2D2D2D, Calibri, dark table headers. Reference script in library/scripts/generate_proposal_docx.py.
- **2026-02-25**: Sofar Ocean proposal completed and uploaded to GDrive (Sofar Ocean subfolder in deals folder). Two-option structure: Dev Only $56.1K / Full Service $78K.
- **2026-02-25**: Dimer Health deal expanded from stalled $10K retainer to formal RFP for full marketing & growth partnership. Selling as VAN. Presentation approach (not doc). AEO score 62.96/100 — ChatGPT confuses them with a UV disinfection company. Outline drafted, finishing Feb 26.
- **2026-02-26**: CapGrow proposal review call completed. Sydney engaged, no price pushback on $66,700. She's comparing vendors — decision by end of March. WAIO was the standout add-on (strong interest). SEO audit = pass. She budgeted $10-12K/yr for maintenance — educated on Webflow's zero-maintenance model vs active support plans. Requested designer with startup/nonprofit/human-centric background. Rate discrepancy: said $150/hr on call, proposal is $175/hr — needs reconciliation before SOW. Full transcript in Granola.
- **2026-02-26**: Follow-up lesson: when a prospect is comparing vendors, add value in the gap. Don't just "check in" — send something useful each touchpoint (portfolio examples, WAIO preview, hosting breakdown). Every follow-up should make her more informed, not more pressured.
- **2026-02-27**: Dimer Health proposal review call with Arielle. Series A closed (not seed). 10x in 2 years, new product beta in 2 months, announcement end of March. Yaya offered free homepage concept = major competitive edge. Full call notes: `deals/dimer-health/notes/2026-02-27-proposal-review-call.md`. Alberto Conceicao swapped in for Collin Belt on team table (Marketing Specialist).
