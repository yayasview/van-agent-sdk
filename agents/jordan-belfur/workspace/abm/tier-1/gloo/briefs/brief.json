Gloo has expanded its market reach through strategic acquisitions, including XRI Global for advanced AI capabilities (November 2025), and Igniter (September 2025) and Masterworks (July 2025) in faith-focused media and fundraising. They also opened a new office in Silicon Valley in October 2025.

In terms of marketing and AI development, Gloo has promoted its values-aligned AI through initiatives like an AI benchmark released in December 2025 and an AI hackathon in October 2025, and by bringing AI solutions to media professionals in January 2025. A notable leadership change occurred with Pat Gelsinger's appointment as Executive Chair and Head of Technology in March 2025. Gloo has also strengthened its partnerships, including a deeper collaboration with Barna Group (March 2025), a partnership with Faith Assistant (January 2025), and a new strategic technology partnership with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (January 2026).

    "why_now": "Rebecca Mann Kelly is first 6 months into their role—the window for new partnerships is open now but closes as they settle into existing vendor relationships. Recent news shows active company momentum (product launches, partnerships)—web presence needs to keep pace with business growth. They're early in their Webflow journey (3 projects)—now is the time to establish VAN as their go-to Webflow partner before they build internal muscle or find another agency. Post-funding momentum (Growth, 2 months ago) means budget is available for strategic initiatives.",
    "why_van": "VAN's deep Webflow expertise is directly relevant—they're already invested in the platform and need a partner who can help them maximize that investment. Multiple marketing stakeholders suggests a team that needs agency support—VAN's network model provides the breadth of expertise they need without managing multiple vendor relationships."
