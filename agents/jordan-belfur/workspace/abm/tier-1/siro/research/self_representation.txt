Company Description: At Siro, we believe that face-to-face sales conversations are the most valuable moments in business. For too long they’ve been invisible, lost the moment they happen, with no way to coach, learn, or grow from them.
Offering Description: Siro allows leaders to understand what’s really happening when team members are out representing your brand. No more guessing if a process is followed or why a sale was lost, our AI-enabled app captures and analyzes each customer conversation in real time.
Target Audience: We serve field sales teams, sales leaders, operations and enablement teams, and industries with in‑person selling—helping improve customer engagement, coaching, and performance through data‑driven insights.
Differentiators: Reps don’t even need to take notes!
Tagline: Turn conversations into intelligence.
