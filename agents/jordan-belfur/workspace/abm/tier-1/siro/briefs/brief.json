Recent news shows active company momentum (product launches, partnerships)—web presence needs to keep pace with business growth. They're early in their Webflow journey (1 projects)—now is the time to establish VAN as their go-to Webflow partner before they build internal muscle or find another agency. Post-funding momentum (Series B, 8 months ago) means budget is available for strategic initiatives.",
    "why_van": "VAN's deep Webflow expertise is directly relevant—they're already invested in the platform and need a partner who can help them maximize that investment. Multiple marketing stakeholders suggests a team that needs agency support—VAN's network model provides the breadth of expertise they need without managing multiple vendor relationships."
