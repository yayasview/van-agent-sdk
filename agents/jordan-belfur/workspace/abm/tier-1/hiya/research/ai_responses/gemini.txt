Okay, let's break down Hiya.

**What is Hiya?**

Hiya is a company that provides call security and caller ID services.  Essentially, they help protect people from unwanted calls like spam, scams, and robocalls, while also helping legitimate businesses connect with their customers more effectively.

**What do they do?**

*   **Spam and Scam Detection:**  Hiya identifies and blocks or flags spam and scam calls. They use a combination of algorithms, machine learning, and a real-time feedback loop from users to identify and categorize unwanted calls.
*   **Caller ID:**  They provide enhanced caller ID information, showing the name and sometimes even the logo of the business calling, even if that number isn't saved in your contacts.
*   **Call Blocking & Screening:** Hiya allows users (and businesses through their enterprise services) to block unwanted numbers and screen calls based on risk level.
*   **Reputation Management (for Businesses):** They help businesses manage their phone number reputation, ensuring their legitimate calls aren't mistakenly flagged as spam.  This includes tools to monitor their phone number's reputation and dispute incorrect flagging.
*   **Call Analytics:** Provides insight into call patterns, volume, and spam activity for both consumers and businesses.

**Who do they serve?**

Hiya serves two primary groups:
