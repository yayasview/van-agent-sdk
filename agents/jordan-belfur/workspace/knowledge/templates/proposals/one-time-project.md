## 3. Scope of Work

> **Important:** The scope defined in this section is the complete and binding project scope. Only items explicitly listed under "In Scope" are included in this engagement. Any work not listed here is considered out of scope and will require a formal change order. Verbal discussions during the sales process do not modify or extend this scope.

### 3.1 In Scope

#### Webflow Development ({{dev_hours}} hours)
{{webflow_dev_scope}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Itemize all development deliverables. Be explicit — if it's not listed here, it's not in scope. Standard items include:
> - Fully responsive development across desktop, tablet, and mobile
> - Component-based build using a structured design system
> - All animations and interactions included
> - All pages built per the proposed sitemap (see Sitemap Disclaimer below — sitemap is non-final until formally approved post-kickoff)
> - CMS collections for {{cms_content_types}}
> - Dynamic templates for all CMS items
> - Forms setup, {{crm_platform}} integration, and required automations
> - Redirect mapping (201/301s)
> - Technical SEO implementation
> - Webflow hosting configuration

#### CMS Setup & Content Migration ({{cms_hours}} hours)
- CMS architecture configuration
- Importing all existing content into Webflow CMS
- Ensuring formatting, relationships, and metadata remain intact

#### Technical SEO ({{seo_hours}} hours)
- Metadata setup (titles, descriptions)
- Heading hierarchy
- Structured internal linking
- Alt tags and accessibility improvements
- Sitemap and redirects
- Core Web Vitals optimization
- WAIO implementation (if included) — $5,000 value

#### Design System + Project Setup (First {{setup_weeks}} Weeks)
- Webflow project configuration
- Design tokens
- Style guide
- Component library setup

#### Quality Assurance
- Cross-browser testing
- Device-specific QA
- Regression testing across templates

#### Project Tracking
- Real-time task dashboard provided for full project visibility
- Client can follow progress, milestones, and deliverable status at any time
- No emailed or delivered weekly project reports — the task dashboard is the single source of truth for project status

> **BDR Instructions:** Do NOT promise emailed EOW reports, weekly recaps, or delivered progress reports of any kind. All project tracking is via the shared task dashboard only. This policy is subject to change if tooling evolves to support automated reporting, but for now, dashboard only.

#### Sitemap Disclaimer

> **The sitemap included in this proposal is non-final and provided for initial scoping and pricing reference only.** A dedicated sitemap finalization exercise will be conducted after project kickoff. This is a critical gate that must be completed before design work begins.
>
> The client may either:
> 1. **Trust our recommendation** to finalize quickly and maintain project momentum, or
> 2. **Allocate additional weeks** for a thorough back-and-forth review and full confirmation process.
>
> Design and development will not begin until the sitemap is formally approved. Any pages added beyond the approved sitemap will require a change order.

#### Post-Launch Support ({{support_weeks}} Weeks, Included)
- Bug fixes
- Minor adjustments
- Developer availability for real-world usage feedback
- Transition support for internal team

### 3.2 Out of Scope

> **BDR Instructions:** Always include an out-of-scope section. Be explicit — this section is critical for preventing scope disputes at kickoff. If something was discussed in sales calls but is NOT listed in Section 3.1, it must either be added to In Scope before the proposal is sent, or it belongs here. Do not leave room for ambiguity.

The following items are **not included** in this engagement. Any of these items can be added via a formal change order with transparent hourly estimates and client approval before work begins.

- Net-new pages not included in the approved sitemap
- Copywriting, content creation, or content strategy
- Photography, videography, or custom illustration
- New 3D assets or externally created animations requiring a motion designer
- New product categories or additional CMS structures added mid-project
- Custom backend development or server-side logic
- Third-party platform integrations not specified in Section 3.1
- Ongoing site iteration after the included support window
- Any work not explicitly listed in Section 3.1 above

## 4. Project Timeline

**Total duration:** ~{{total_weeks}} weeks

### Project Plan

{{project_plan}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Use the standard 12-week waterfalled project plan below as a baseline for mid-sized projects. Scale up or down depending on project size.
>
> **Critical rules:**
> - **No calendar dates.** Only reference Week 1, Week 2, etc. Never include specific dates.
> - **Phases are fully waterfalled** — no overlapping phases. Each phase must complete and receive client approval before the next begins. No work bleeds between phases.
> - **Every phase is gated by a client approval step.** Approval gates are non-negotiable — work does not proceed until sign-off is received.
> - **Client delays = timeline delays.** Make this explicit. If approval takes 2 extra weeks, the entire project shifts 2 weeks.
>
> **Standard 12-Week Mid-Sized Project Plan:**
>
> | Phase | Weeks | Focus | Client Responsibility |
> |-------|-------|-------|-----------------------|
> | **Phase 1: Discovery & Kickoff** | Week 1 | Kickoff call, requirements confirmation, sitemap finalization exercise begins | Attend kickoff, provide all brand assets and content, confirm stakeholders |
> | **APPROVAL GATE** | — | **Client approves final sitemap and project requirements** | **Sign-off required before design begins** |
> | **Phase 2: Design System & Wireframes** | Week 2–3 | Design tokens, style guide, component library, page wireframes | Review and provide consolidated feedback (2 revision rounds max) |
> | **APPROVAL GATE** | — | **Client approves design system and wireframes** | **Sign-off required before page design begins** |
> | **Phase 3: Page Design** | Week 4–5 | Full page designs for all unique templates | Review and provide consolidated feedback (2 revision rounds max) |
> | **APPROVAL GATE** | — | **Client approves all page designs** | **Sign-off required before development begins — no design changes accepted after this point** |
> | **Phase 4: Development** | Week 6–8 | Webflow build, responsive development, interactions, CMS architecture | Available for questions, provide final content and copy |
> | **APPROVAL GATE** | — | **Client reviews staging site and approves build** | **Confirm staging site matches approved designs** |
> | **Phase 5: Content Migration & SEO** | Week 9–10 | Content population, metadata, redirects, technical SEO | Review migrated content for accuracy |
> | **APPROVAL GATE** | — | **Client approves content and SEO setup** | **Confirm all content is correct before launch prep** |
> | **Phase 6: QA & Pre-Launch** | Week 11 | Cross-browser testing, device QA, performance optimization | Final review of staging site |
> | **APPROVAL GATE** | — | **Client gives final launch authorization** | **Written launch approval required** |
> | **Phase 7: Launch & Handoff** | Week 12 | DNS cutover, go-live, post-launch monitoring, support window begins | Confirm domain/DNS access, monitor post-launch |
>
> **Note:** This timeline assumes timely client feedback and approval at each gate. Delays in client approvals will shift all subsequent phases by an equivalent duration. Progress is tracked via the shared task dashboard at all times.

## Payment Details

**Non-Refundable Payments:** At the time of signing this agreement, the first payment is due and non-refundable. This payment will secure the Consultant's availability and commitment to the project.

**Cancellation Policy:** The Client may cancel this agreement with a 90-day written notice. In the event of cancellation, the Client forfeits the previously paid last month's deposit. Services will continue during the cancellation period to ensure a smooth transition.

**Payment Method:** All payments under this agreement are to be made via ACH direct deposit. Payment instructions will be provided upon signing the agreement.

---

## Terms & Conditions

**Assumptions:** {{agency_name}} is of the assumption that the Client has the capacity to provide all information and data that is reasonably required for {{agency_name}} to complete the delivery of the project.

**Communication & Collaboration:** All project communication will be conducted exclusively via Slack. The Client agrees to join and actively participate in the designated Slack channel for the duration of the engagement. All project discussions, feedback, approvals, and file sharing must occur in Slack. {{agency_name}} does not support project communication via email, Microsoft Teams, Zoom chat, or any other messaging platform. Meetings will be held via Google Meet (or a {{agency_name}}-designated video conferencing tool). This policy exists to ensure streamlined collaboration, centralized project records, and consistent response times across all stakeholders.

**Subscription Payments:** This scope of work constitutes a monthly subscription agreement between Client and {{agency_name}}. {{agency_name}} uses Capchase Pay as a Vendor for accepting monthly payments from its Clients. Payments made by Capchase to {{agency_name}} on Client's behalf will be considered payments made by the Client. The Client agrees to submit payment details through Capchase's designated payment link prior to the due date of the first payment. Additionally, the Client consents to make payments via direct ACH debit according the payment schedule provided in the designated link.

**Confidentiality:** In view of the fact that Agency's work will bring Agency into close contact with many confidential affairs of Client not readily available to the public, and plans for future developments, Agency agrees to keep secret all matters, except for the existence of this engagement generally, and further agrees not to disclose any such matters to anyone outside of Agency throughout the term of this agreement, without written consent from Client.

**Intellectual Property:** Upon successful completion and launch of the website, all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, designs, code, and related content created specifically for this project, will be transferred to the Client. Any pre-existing intellectual property owned by {{agency_name}} or third parties used in the project will remain the property of the respective owner(s), and rights to such pre-existing intellectual property will be addressed separately as needed. {{agency_name}} will ensure the originality of the work and will cease to use or claim any rights to the intellectual property post-launch, except as expressly permitted by the Client.

**Revisions:** During the design phase, clients are entitled to two (2) rounds of revisions per page template. We recommend providing timely feedback to keep the project on schedule; delays in delivering client revisions will result in an equivalent extension of the overall project timeline. Once a page has been fully developed according to the approved design, no further design changes will be made during the development phase. Any additional design modifications at this stage will require a formal change order, to be agreed upon and signed by both parties. Such changes will incur an additional cost of US${{hourly_rate}}/hour and may extend the project timeline accordingly.

**Late Payments:** For all fees not received by {{agency_name}} on or before the day upon which such Fees are due shall thereafter be subject, in {{agency_name}}'s sole discretion, to accrue interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding amount per month, or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. {{agency_name}} shall further have the right to suspend the performance of all Services, if any payment due and payable goes unpaid. {{agency_name}} also reserves the right to submit any balance to collections.

**Shadow Care™:** Our guarantee to you, if you are not happy with the services provided and we did not meet your requirements as initially outlined by the second approval stage, we will give you 100% of your money back.

**Master Services Agreement:** By signing this SOW, you agree to our Master Services Agreement, located at {{msa_url}}, and to the deliverables, payment schedule, and terms listed above.
