**Siro is an AI-powered sales coaching and conversation intelligence platform designed specifically for field sales teams conducting in-person conversations, such as handshakes or in-home presentations.[1][2][5][6]**

It records, transcribes, and analyzes these interactions in real-time via a mobile app, providing data-driven insights, performance scorecards, coaching highlights on critical moments (e.g., objection handling), cross-sell opportunities, and custom follow-up messaging—without requiring reps to take notes.[1][2][3][5][6] The platform empowers sales reps with tools to improve, enables managers to coach efficiently (overcoming the challenge of unobserved field work), and helps leaders gain visibility into processes, lost sales reasons, and customer insights.[1][2][6] Key features include offline mode for low-data areas and integration like SalesPro with Service Titan in 2024.[1][3]

Siro primarily serves field sales teams in industries like **home services**, **auto repair**, **home improvement**, **telecom**, **B2B**, **door-to-door**, and **political canvassing**, targeting the 5.7 million U.S. field sales professionals who often lack on-the-job coaching.[2][3][6] Customers include owners, sales leaders, and reps in these sectors, with early growth to over 3,000 reps by 2021 and partnerships like Service Titan.[1]

**What differentiates Siro**: It focuses exclusively on **in-person/field sales** (not call centers or virtual), making it uniquely suited for "handshake" scenarios where traditional coaching is impractical due to reps being "alone in the field."[2][3][4][5] Unlike general sales tools, it emphasizes rep empowerment from first principles, AI-driven analysis of unrecorded conversations, and outcomes like stack-ranked opportunities—positioning field sales as a path to financial freedom (reps can out-earn surgeons/lawyers with proper tooling).[1][2] Founded in 2020 in New York with ~15-25 employees, it has raised Seed, Series A (2023), and Series B funding.[1][4]

Siro is **known for** boosting in-person sales performance: average customer results include **20% revenue growth**, **9% higher close rates**, and **8% larger ticket sizes**, plus milestones like 1M conversations recorded by 2022.[1][6] It's recognized as an innovator in AI coaching for overlooked field sales.[2][4][5]

**Customer feedback** is mixed. Proponents value AI analysis, offline capabilities, and field-specific coaching for home services.[3][6] Critics note **high pricing** ($3,000+ per user annually with minimum commitments and annual contracts), lack of call center support (creating funnel gaps), limited customization, and non-specialization for home services (better alternatives like Craft AI cited for comprehensive coaching and value).[3] One roofing owner preferred a competitor for better pricing and dual call/field coverage.[3] Overall, it's seen as worthwhile for pure field sales focus if budget fits, but not ideal for integrated sales operations.[3]
