Hi Daniel,

Great kicking things off today — excited to get moving on this.

As discussed, here's the proposal for the connect.kooth.com migration to Webflow, along with the project plan the team put together:

- [Proposal — Kooth Connect | Webflow Migration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TIj-tCCXX_RgNZQM4DuxG9z1M9W3kke6O_hpj9gyUJ0/edit)
- [Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDBB18XOIyDvy9Hmd9RDEUrJzjPTkepy-gA5k35r5AQ/edit)

Quick summary:
- 342 hours across development, content migration, SEO, QA, and project management
- ~12 weeks (10 active + 2-week support sprint included at no cost)
- $51,300 total at the $150/hr MSA rate
- Includes WAIO implementation and CMS training for your team

Take a look when you get a chance and let me know if anything needs adjusting. Happy to jump on a quick call to walk through it if that's easier.

Best,
Yaya
