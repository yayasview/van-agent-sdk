## 1. Executive Summary

Kooth Digital Health has established itself as a leader in accessible, digital-first mental health support — serving young people, adults, and healthcare systems across the UK and beyond. As our partnership on the Soluna platform migration continues, Kooth has identified an opportunity to bring its corporate stakeholder site, connect.kooth.com, onto Webflow — unifying its web presence under a single, modern platform that the marketing team can own and evolve independently.

This proposal covers the full migration of connect.kooth.com from its current Next.js/Contentful stack to Webflow Enterprise. The engagement includes approximately 50 pages across static content, dynamic collections, and CMS-driven templates — encompassing Kooth's services, clinical model, research, news, careers, and partner resources.

Key deliverables and guarantees include:

- Fully responsive, high-performance Webflow build across all 50+ pages
- 90+ Google Lighthouse SEO score target
- Structured CMS architecture for articles, resources, news, FAQs, leadership, case studies, insights, events, and careers
- Complete content migration from Contentful with formatting and metadata preserved
- Technical SEO implementation including redirect mapping, metadata, and Core Web Vitals optimization
- Component-based design system for long-term maintainability
- 2-week post-launch support sprint (included at no additional cost)

By consolidating connect.kooth.com alongside Soluna on Webflow, Kooth's marketing team gains direct control over both properties — reducing reliance on engineering resources and accelerating the pace of content updates, campaigns, and stakeholder communications.

- Migrate the full connect.kooth.com site from Next.js/Contentful to Webflow Enterprise

- Enable Kooth's marketing team to manage ~80% of site updates independently without engineering support
- Preserve all existing content, URL structures, and search equity through proper redirect mapping
- Implement accessibility best practices consistent with Kooth's commitment to equitable digital access
- Create a reusable component library and design system for consistency across all pages
- Deliver a seamless transition with zero downtime during DNS cutover

## 3. Scope of Work

> **Important:** The scope defined in this section is the complete and binding project scope. Only items explicitly listed under "In Scope" are included in this engagement.

#### Sitemap Disclaimer

> **The sitemap included in this proposal is non-final and provided for initial scoping and pricing reference only.** A dedicated sitemap finalization exercise will be conducted after project kickoff. This is a critical gate that must be completed before design work begins.
>
> The client may either:
> 1. **Trust our recommendation** to finalize quickly and maintain project momentum, or
> 2. **Allocate additional weeks** for a thorough back-and-forth review and full confirmation process.
>
> Design and development will not begin until the sitemap is formally approved. Any pages added beyond the approved sitemap will require a change order.

#### Post-Launch Support (2 Weeks, Included)

- Bug fixes and minor adjustments
- Developer availability for real-world usage feedback
- Transition support for internal team
- CMS training and content workflow enablement

## Payment Details

**Non-Refundable Payments:** At the time of signing this agreement, the first payment is due and non-refundable. This payment will secure the Consultant's availability and commitment to the project.

**Cancellation Policy:** The Client may cancel this agreement with a 90-day written notice. In the event of cancellation, the Client forfeits the previously paid last month's deposit. Services will continue during the cancellation period to ensure a smooth transition.

**Payment Method:** All payments under this agreement are to be made via ACH direct deposit. Payment instructions will be provided upon signing the agreement.

---

## Terms & Conditions

**Assumptions:** VAN is of the assumption that the Client has the capacity to provide all information and data that is reasonably required for VAN to complete the delivery of the project.

**Communication & Collaboration:** All project communication will be conducted exclusively via Slack. The Client agrees to join and actively participate in the designated Slack channel for the duration of the engagement. All project discussions, feedback, approvals, and file sharing must occur in Slack. VAN does not support project communication via email, Microsoft Teams, Zoom chat, or any other messaging platform. Meetings will be held via Google Meet (or a VAN-designated video conferencing tool). This policy exists to ensure streamlined collaboration, centralized project records, and consistent response times across all stakeholders.

**Subscription Payments:** This scope of work constitutes a monthly subscription agreement between Client and VAN. VAN uses Capchase Pay as a Vendor for accepting monthly payments from its Clients. Payments made by Capchase to VAN on Client's behalf will be considered payments made by the Client. The Client agrees to submit payment details through Capchase's designated payment link prior to the due date of the first payment. Additionally, the Client consents to make payments via direct ACH debit according the payment schedule provided in the designated link.

**Confidentiality:** In view of the fact that Agency's work will bring Agency into close contact with many confidential affairs of Client not readily available to the public, and plans for future developments, Agency agrees to keep secret all matters, except for the existence of this engagement generally, and further agrees not to disclose any such matters to anyone outside of Agency throughout the term of this agreement, without written consent from Client.

**Intellectual Property:** Upon successful completion and launch of the website, all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, designs, code, and related content created specifically for this project, will be transferred to the Client. Any pre-existing intellectual property owned by VAN or third parties used in the project will remain the property of the respective owner(s), and rights to such pre-existing intellectual property will be addressed separately as needed. VAN will ensure the originality of the work and will cease to use or claim any rights to the intellectual property post-launch, except as expressly permitted by the Client.

**Revisions:** During the design phase, clients are entitled to two (2) rounds of revisions per page template. We recommend providing timely feedback to keep the project on schedule; delays in delivering client revisions will result in an equivalent extension of the overall project timeline. Once a page has been fully developed according to the approved design, no further design changes will be made during the development phase. Any additional design modifications at this stage will require a formal change order, to be agreed upon and signed by both parties. Such changes will incur an additional cost of US$150/hour and may extend the project timeline accordingly.

**Late Payments:** For all fees not received by VAN on or before the day upon which such Fees are due shall thereafter be subject, in VAN's sole discretion, to accrue interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding amount per month, or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. VAN shall further have the right to suspend the performance of all Services, if any payment due and payable goes unpaid. VAN also reserves the right to submit any balance to collections.

**Shadow Care™:** Our guarantee to you, if you are not happy with the services provided and we did not meet your requirements as initially outlined by the second approval stage, we will give you 100% of your money back.

**Master Services Agreement:** By signing this SOW, you agree to our Master Services Agreement, located at https://www.shadowdigital.cc/legal/master-services-agreement-12-18-2024, and to the deliverables, payment schedule, and terms listed above.
