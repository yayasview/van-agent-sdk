## Common Onboarding Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Client Asks "When Do We Start?"
**Response**: "We officially kick off on [date]. Our team is currently preparing the [initial deliverable] and will have something for you to review by [date]."

### Issue: Client Isn't Available for Kickoff Call
**Action**:
1. Don't delay; reschedule
2. Offer 2-3 alternative times
3. If still can't connect: "Should we move forward with [initial work], or do you want to wait for the kick-off call first?"
4. Set firm deadline: "We need to connect by [date] to stay on track."

### Issue: Team Says "We Don't Have Context" Post-Kickoff
**Action**: Means internal brief wasn't clear enough. Resend brief + kickoff notes recap. Do quick team huddle to align (15 min).

### Issue: Billing Contact Different from Primary Contact
**Action**: Get billing contact info separately from primary project contact. Update accounting immediately.

### Issue: Client Wants to Start Before Kickoff
**Pro Approach**: "We want to ensure we get it right. Let's do a quick kickoff—10 minutes—to confirm [key detail], and we'll start immediately after." (Keeps things moving, maintains process)

---

## Post-Onboarding (Day 7-14)

### First Project Check-In

**Timing**: 5-7 days after project start

**Purpose**: Ensure project is on track, team has what they need, client has no early concerns

**Attendees**: You (sales), project lead, client contact

**Check-in Topics**:
- "How's the first week going?"
- "Do you have everything you need from us?"
- "Any early feedback or questions?"
- "Anything we should know about?"
- "Timeline still working for you?"

**Outcome**: Quick sync (15-20 min), confirm all is well, address any early concerns

### Internal Team Sync

**Timing**: After first week

**Purpose**: Team reflects on project start, identifies any issues

**Questions**:
- Is client providing feedback/materials on schedule?
- Are there any scope creep discussions?
- Does team have everything needed to deliver?
- Any blockers from client side?

**Action**: Address issues immediately; don't let them compound.

---

## Summary

**Onboarding is the bridge from sales to delivery.** Do it thoroughly and systematically. A well-executed onboarding sets the tone for the entire engagement and prevents surprises later. Verify every step is complete before the team starts work.
