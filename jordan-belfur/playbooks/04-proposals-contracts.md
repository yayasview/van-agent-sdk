# Proposals & Contracts Playbook

## Purpose
Create professional, customized proposals and contracts that clearly outline scope, pricing, and terms to drive deal closure.

## 1. How to Draft a Proposal Using VAN Templates + Deal Context

### When to Send a Proposal
**Trigger**: Prospect has completed discovery call AND you understand their needs AND they've expressed interest in next steps.

**Don't send proposal if**:
- Discovery call hasn't happened yet
- Prospect hasn't confirmed budget range
- Scope is unclear (would result in vague proposal)

### Proposal Development Process

#### Step 1: Gather Deal Context from HubSpot
1. Open relevant deal in HubSpot
2. Review all deal notes and activities
3. Confirm these data points are documented:
   - Company name, industry, size
   - Key contact person (decision-maker and other stakeholders)
   - Stated pain point or goal (use their exact language)
   - Budget range (confirmed or estimated)
   - Timeline (when do they want to start?)
   - Competing options (if they mentioned other vendors)
   - Any specific requirements or constraints mentioned

#### Step 2: Select Appropriate VAN Template
VAN has service-specific proposal templates:
- **Web Design/Development**: `van-template-web-design.docx`
- **Digital Marketing**: `van-template-digital-marketing.docx`
- **App Development**: `van-template-app-dev.docx`
- **Brand/UX**: `van-template-brand.docx`
- **General Services**: `van-template-general.docx`

**Find templates**: Shared drive > VAN Shared > Sales Templates > Proposals

#### Step 3: Create New Proposal Document
1. Download applicable template
2. Save as new file: `[Date]-[Company]-[ServiceType]-Proposal-Draft.docx`
   - Example: `2025-02-10-TechCorp-WebDev-Proposal-Draft.docx`
3. Keep original template intact (always work from copy)

#### Step 4: Customize the Proposal
**Section-by-section customization**:

**A. Title Page / Cover**
- Replace: [Company Name] → Prospect's company name
- Replace: [Date] → Today's date
- Replace: [Contact Name] → Primary prospect contact
- Add: Proposal expiration date (typically 14-21 days from send date)

**B. Executive Summary** (1/2 page)
- Replace: [Company Challenge/Opportunity] → Their specific pain point (use their words)
- Replace: [Proposed Solution] → Brief overview of what VAN will do
- Replace: [Expected Outcome] → Business result they'll achieve
- Tone: Professional, benefits-focused, not feature-focused

Example:
```
BEFORE (Template):
TechCorp is looking to modernize their digital presence and increase web conversions.
VAN will design and develop a new website using best practices.
The result will be improved user experience and increased leads.

AFTER (Customized):
TechCorp's current website is losing customers at checkout (25% abandonment rate).
We'll redesign the checkout flow and optimize for mobile conversion.
Expected result: 30-40% reduction in cart abandonment, 15-20% increase in completed orders.
```

**C. Company Background / Context** (optional, 1/4-1/2 page)
- Include: Why you chose them, what you know about their industry/market
- Example: "TechCorp is a B2B SaaS company in the HR tech space, competing with larger players like Workday. Their differentiator is ease of use for non-technical HR teams."

**D. Situation Analysis / Problem Statement** (1/2-1 page)
- Replace: [Current Situation] → What their situation is today (from discovery call)
- Replace: [Challenges/Gaps] → Problems they mentioned
- Replace: [Opportunities] → What they could improve

Example:
```
CURRENT SITUATION:
- Website built 4 years ago, not mobile-optimized
- Checkout process is 5 steps (industry standard is 3)
- No clear value proposition above the fold
- 60% of traffic abandons before conversion

CHALLENGES:
- New competitors entering market with better UX
- Sales team struggling with long sales cycle (45 days avg)
- Product team getting blamed for "bad marketing"

OPPORTUNITIES:
- Simplify messaging to highlight ease-of-use
- Improve conversion funnel to support Q2 growth target
- Create marketing site to accelerate prospect education
```

**E. Proposed Solution / Scope of Work** (1-2 pages)
This is the most important section. Be specific.

**Replace template with**:
- Phase 1: [Specific deliverables] by [timeline]
  - Example: "Phase 1: User research & competitive analysis, site architecture, wireframes (Due: Feb 28)"
- Phase 2: [Specific deliverables] by [timeline]
- Phase 3: [Specific deliverables] by [timeline]

Include deliverables, not vague descriptions:

```
BEFORE (Vague):
Phase 1: Design Phase
- Conduct user research
- Create wireframes
- Design mockups

AFTER (Specific):
Phase 1: Strategy & Discovery (4 weeks, Feb 10 - Mar 10)
- 5 hours of user interviews with 8 active users
- Competitive analysis of top 5 competitors
- Journey mapping and user personas (1-2 pages)
- Site architecture and information hierarchy diagram
- Medium-fidelity wireframes for homepage, product page, checkout (3-step flow)
- Design system/style guide (colors, typography, components)

Deliverable(s): Wireframes doc, design system, recommendations memo
Feedback/Revision rounds: 2 (client can request minor changes)
```

**F. Timeline / Project Schedule** (1/2 page, visual)
- Create simple Gantt or timeline showing:
  - Phase start/end dates
  - Key milestones
  - Approval points where client input needed
  - Go-live or launch date

Example:
```
Feb 10 - Mar 10: Design Phase
Mar 11 - Apr 21: Development Phase
Apr 22 - May 2: Testing & Revisions
May 3+: Launch + 30-day support

Key Dates:
- Feb 28: Wireframes review → Client approval required
- Mar 15: Design mockups ready → Client review
- Apr 30: Development complete → Testing begins
- May 3: Launch
```

**G. Investment / Pricing** (1/2 page)
- Replace: [Service 1] with actual service names
- Replace: [Cost] with actual pricing
- Include payment schedule if applicable

Example:
```
INVESTMENT SUMMARY:

Phase 1: Strategy & Design      $12,500
Phase 2: Development (12 wks)   $28,000
Phase 3: Testing & Launch       $5,000
Post-Launch Support (30 days)   $2,500
─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL PROJECT INVESTMENT        $48,000

PAYMENT SCHEDULE:
- 50% ($24,000) due upon kickoff
- 25% ($12,000) due upon design approval
- 25% ($12,000) due upon launch

Optional Services (not included):
- Ongoing monthly SEO optimization: $2,000/month
- Ongoing maintenance & support: $500/month
```

**H. Success Metrics** (1/2 page)
- Define how success will be measured
- Should tie back to their stated goal

Example:
```
SUCCESS METRICS:

We'll measure the success of this project by:
- Checkout completion rate: Target 75% (up from current 40%)
- Mobile conversion rate: 85% of desktop conversion rate
- Page load time: < 2 seconds on 4G
- User satisfaction: 4.5+ stars on post-launch survey
- Time to complete checkout: Average 3 minutes (down from 8 minutes)

We'll track these metrics for 30 days post-launch and provide weekly reports.
```

**I. VAN Overview** (1/2-1 page)
- Use standard VAN bio from template
- Include: VAN experience, relevant case studies, team bios (if relationship is new)
- Keep brief; they chose you for a reason

**J. Terms & Conditions** (standard, 1 page)

- Include:
  - Scope limitations (what's NOT included)
  - Change order process (how to request changes beyond scope)
  - Payment terms
  - Timeline/delay clauses

## 4. How to Prepare Docs for PandaDoc

### Why Use PandaDoc?
- Creates e-signature-ready documents
- Tracks when prospect views/opens
- Allows signing without printing/scanning
- Professional appearance
- Easy follow-up reminders built-in

### Converting Word Doc to PandaDoc

#### Step 1: Save Finalized Proposal as PDF
1. Open completed proposal in Word
2. File > Export as PDF
3. Save as: `[Date]-[Company]-[ServiceType]-Proposal-Final.pdf`

#### Step 2: Upload to PandaDoc
1. Log into PandaDoc account
2. Click "Create document"
3. Select "Upload a document"
4. Upload the PDF
5. Click "Start editing"

#### Step 3: Set Up PandaDoc Signature Fields
1. Click where signature should go (typically end of proposal)
2. Select "Signature field"
3. Select "Date field" next to signature (auto-fills when signed)
4. Repeat for any other signature lines (e.g., if multiple signers)

#### Step 4: Add Recipient Information
1. Click "Add recipient"
2. Name: Primary prospect contact
3. Email: Their email address
4. Role: "Signer"
5. Repeat for any co-signers or stakeholders who need to see it

#### Step 5: Set Expiration & Reminders
1. Click "Settings"
2. Set "Document expires in": 14 or 21 days (your choice)
3. Enable "Reminder email" every 3 days if unsigned
4. Click "Save"

#### Step 6: Send Document
1. Review recipient list (correct emails)
2. Add message: "Hi [Name], attached is the proposal for [project]. Please review and sign by [DATE]. Questions? Let me know!"
3. Click "Send"

### PandaDoc Best Practices
- **Only create PandaDoc after they've approved concept** (don't send unsigned PandaDoc cold; send Word draft first)
- **Set 14-21 day expiration** (creates urgency without being aggressive)
- **Enable reminders** (auto-send after 3, 7, 10 days)
- **Monitor opens** (PandaDoc shows when they open; if they open multiple times, they're reviewing)
- **Note in HubSpot**: When PandaDoc sent, add link and expiration date to deal activity

## 6. Amendment Handling

### When to Amend a Contract
- Scope changed (client asks to add/remove deliverables)
- Timeline extended
- Pricing changed (e.g., discount granted, add-on service included)
- Terms negotiated differently (payment schedule, liability, IP, etc.)

### Amendment Process

**Step 1: Identify Change**
- Document exactly what's different from original contract
- Example: "Add 10 additional hours of design revisions; increase total from $45K to $47K"

**Step 2: Draft Amendment**
- Create amendment document (or use PandaDoc "Create amendment")
- Format:
  ```
  AMENDMENT TO SERVICE AGREEMENT
  Original Agreement Date: [Original contract date]
  Amendment Date: [Today]
  Between: [Company Name] and VAN Agencies

  CHANGE:
  Remove from original agreement:
  [Original language]

  Add to original agreement:
  [New language]

  New total: $[amount] (was $[original amount])
  All other terms remain unchanged.
  ```

**Step 3: Send Amendment to Client**
- Use PandaDoc (same as proposal) or via email for approval
- Set signature deadline (typically 3-5 days)
- Message: "We've documented the changes we discussed. Please review and sign by [date]."

**Step 4: Client Signs Amendment**
- Once signed in PandaDoc, download signed copy
- Store in project folder

**Step 5: Update Internal Records**
- Update HubSpot deal amount (if price changed)
- Update deal notes with amendment details
- Notify accounting of any pricing/payment changes
- Update project management tool with new timeline (if applicable)

### Amendment Don'ts
- Don't assume amendment (get it in writing)
- Don't honor changes verbally; require signature
- Don't delay amendment process (client wants clarity; provide it)
- Don't amend contract multiple times; consolidate changes into one amendment

---

## 7. Follow-Up on Unsigned Proposals/Contracts

### Proposal Not Signed / Not Returned

**Timeline**:
- Day 0: Proposal sent (PandaDoc)
- Day 3: If not opened, send email: "Just checking—did you get the proposal? Let me know if you have questions."
- Day 7: Send check-in: "Any thoughts on the proposal?"
- Day 10: Send: "Proposal expires [DATE]. Want to discuss before it's no longer available?"
- Day 14+: Move deal to "Lost" or follow 03-follow-ups.md process

**For Contract** (higher urgency):
- Day 0: Contract sent (PandaDoc)
- Day 2: If not opened, send email: "Contract is ready to sign. Do you need anything clarified?"
- Day 5: Call or email: "Ready to move forward?"
- Day 7: Escalate to manager or ask: "Do you need to make any changes to move this forward?"

---

## 8. Special Cases

### Case: Prospect Asks for Price Reduction
**Action**:
1. Don't negotiate on price in email; ask for call
2. On call, understand their concern: "What would the project look like at a lower price point?"
3. Options:
   - **Reduce scope** (fewer revisions, fewer phases, fewer deliverables)
   - **Reduce timeline** (faster execution, higher priority, but may cost more)
   - **Offer discount** (10-15% if justified by business case)
   - **Split into phases** (Phase 1 now, Phase 2 later at lower commitment)
4. Document new terms in amendment
5. Don't cave on price without removing scope; that sets wrong precedent

### Case: Prospect Wants Additions Mid-Project
**Action**:
1. Don't add free; prepare change order
2. Document: "Original scope included X. You're now asking for Y (not in original scope). Additional cost: $Z."
3. Get approval before proceeding
4. Create amendment or change order
5. Update timeline if needed (additions take time)

### Case: Prospect Questions Our Pricing
**Approach**:
- Have confidence: "Our pricing reflects [experience level, market rate, value delivered, risk assumed]."
- Provide context: "We could do it cheaper/faster, but quality/timeline would suffer. This is our recommendation for success."
- Offer alternative: "If budget is constraint, let's talk about phasing or adjusted scope."
- Don't over-justify; makes you sound insecure
