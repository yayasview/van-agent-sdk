# Meeting Notes & Recaps Playbook

## Purpose
Convert raw meeting notes into structured recaps that inform deal progression and client communication.

---

## 1. Processing Raw Meeting Notes

### Input Sources
- Google Meet transcripts
- Handwritten notes pasted by sales rep
- Attendee notes shared via email
- AI-generated meeting summaries

### Step 1: Gather All Notes
1. Request transcript from Google Meet (if available)
2. Collect any notes from attendees
3. If handwritten/informal: Reformat into legible outline
4. If multiple sources: Merge into single document

### Step 2: Extract Key Information
From raw notes, identify and highlight:
- **Attendees**: List names, titles, company, email
- **Agenda**: What was discussed? (1-3 main topics)
- **Discovery/Needs**: Pain points, goals, timeline, budget mentioned
- **Solutions Discussed**: What VAN services discussed?
- **Decisions**: What was agreed upon?
- **Objections**: Any concerns raised?
- **Next Steps**: What happens next? Who does what?
- **Timeline**: When is next meeting/decision?

### Step 3: Identify Gaps
Review raw notes. Are these items missing?
- Prospect budget range (if not mentioned, note as "TBD")
- Decision timeline (if not mentioned, note as "Undefined")
- Specific needs/use cases (if vague, flag for clarification)
- Project scope or deliverables discussed (if not clear)

If critical gaps exist, note them as **Follow-up Items** (see Section 2).

### Quality Checks on Raw Notes
- [ ] All attendees identified
- [ ] Agenda/purpose clear
- [ ] Key discussion points legible and comprehensive
- [ ] Decisions recorded (not assumed)
- [ ] Next steps stated explicitly

## 3. How to Draft and Send Recap Emails

### Timing
- **Draft within 4 hours** of meeting ending (while details are fresh)
- **Send within 8 hours** of meeting ending (same business day ideal)
- If meeting at 3 PM on Friday → Send recap by end of Friday OR first thing Monday

### Drafting Process

**Step 1: Brain Dump**
- Quickly write key points from memory (2 min)
- Include any direct quotes about budget, timeline, or goals

**Step 2: Structure**
- Use template above
- Fill in each section with information from raw notes
- Be specific (not vague): "They need a custom integration by Q2 2026" vs. "They need integration sometime"

**Step 3: Tone Check**
- Professional but personable
- No jargon unless they used it first
- Positive and forward-looking
- No exclamation marks in business section (one per email max)

**Step 4: Completeness Check**
- All attendees listed? ✓
- Key discussion points captured? ✓
- Decisions clearly stated? ✓
- Action items specific (not vague)? ✓
- No assumptions (only what was said)? ✓
- Next meeting date confirmed (or "TBD")? ✓

**Step 5: Send**
1. Create email in Gmail
2. To: [Prospect email(s)]
3. CC: Relevant internal team
4. Subject: `Meeting Recap — [Company] — [Date]`
5. Paste recap into email body
6. Attach any supporting docs (if promised during call)
7. Preview and spell-check
8. Send
9. Log in HubSpot (see Section 4)

### Best Practices
- **Use prospect's own language** from the meeting (if they said "we're struggling with visibility," use that term)
- **Confirm decisions/numbers** don't add your interpretation (if they said "possibly $50K," write that, not "budget ~$50K")
- **Add one personalization** (reference something specific they said or asked about)
- **Keep it to 1-2 pages** (use bullets, not paragraphs)

## 4. How to Update HubSpot Deal Notes Post-Meeting

### Step 1: Open Deal Record

### Step 3: Update Deal Fields Based on Meeting
After logging activity, update these deal fields if information changed:

**Update if mentioned**:

- **Close Date**: If timeline mentioned, adjust (e.g., "Budget approval expected Jan 31 → propose close date of Feb 7")

### Step 4: Set Follow-Up Task

## 6. Decision Tree: When to Send Separate vs. Combined Notes

```
→ Did you meet with one contact or multiple?
├─ SINGLE contact from prospect company
│  └─ Send recap to that contact + CC your team lead
├─ MULTIPLE contacts from prospect company
│  └─ Send recap to PRIMARY contact + CC others from prospect company
└─ MULTIPLE stakeholders (e.g., you + project manager attended)
   └─ Send recap to prospect + CC internal team

→ Is this a sensitive or complex discussion?
├─ YES (negotiation, pricing, contract)
│  └─ Send recap only to primary contact or ask "Who should I send this to?"
└─ NO (standard discovery or product discussion)
   └─ Send to all attendees freely
```

## 7. Handling Different Note Scenarios

### Scenario A: Google Meet Transcript Provided
**Advantage**: Full accuracy, easy to search
**Disadvantage**: May be verbose, hard to extract decisions

**Process**:
1. Read full transcript quickly (get context)
2. Re-read and highlight key sections
3. Extract agenda, decisions, and action items
4. Discard pleasantries and off-topic discussion
5. Follow template structure
6. Attach transcript as reference if prospect wants it

### Scenario B: Handwritten Notes
**Advantage**: Often captures key decisions and tone
**Disadvantage**: May be incomplete or unclear

**Process**:
1. Transcribe or clarify any unclear points
2. Check notes for gaps (Is the decision clear? Is timeline stated?)
3. If major gap, reach out to attendee for clarification
4. Structure into template
5. Follow template structure

### Scenario C: No Notes Taken
**Situation**: Meeting happened but no transcript or notes available
**Action**:
1. Immediately after meeting (within 2 hours), recall and document key points
2. If memory is fuzzy, reach out to prospect: "Hi [Name], thanks for the call! Just wanted to confirm my notes—did we agree to [key decision]? And is [timeline] correct?"
3. Wait for confirmation before sending formal recap
4. Send recap once confirmed

### Scenario D: Multiple Internal Attendees
**Situation**: You + sales manager + technical person all attended

**Process**:
1. After meeting, get notes from each attendee (5 min call)
2. Merge notes into single recap (avoid duplicates)
3. Verify technical accuracy with technical attendee
4. Send recap to prospect
5. Log in HubSpot as single activity (not multiple)

---

## 8. Post-Recap Follow-Up Protocol

### If Prospect Doesn't Respond to Recap (No Questions, No Feedback)

**Timeline**:
- **Day 1-2**: No response is normal (they're reviewing)
- **Day 3-5**: Send gentle follow-up if next action item is due
- **Day 7**: If next step is due and no response, send check-in: "Hi [Name], just wanted to check in—do you have any questions about the recap or next steps?"

### If Prospect Responds with Questions
1. **Respond within 4 hours** (same business day)
2. Answer question directly
3. If question reveals new info or changes deal approach, log as activity in HubSpot
4. If question indicates concern/objection, address it and document
5. Set next action item (e.g., "Will send revised proposal by Friday")

### If Prospect Finds Error in Recap
1. Acknowledge immediately: "Thanks for catching that!"
2. Send corrected version with change noted: "Updated: [Original statement] → [Correction]"
3. Apologize for confusion (brief and professional)
4. Don't over-explain
5. Update HubSpot activity with correction

---

## 9. Special Cases

### Case: Prospect Won't Meet But Wants Phone/Email Discussion Only
**Process**:
- Don't call it a "meeting" recap
- Use format: "Summary of [Date] Phone Discussion" or "Email Summary"
- Still use same structured format
- Log in HubSpot as "Call" activity, not "Meeting"

### Case: Internal-Only Debrief (No Prospect Recap Sent)
**Situation**: You debrief with sales team post-call, no prospect recap needed

**Process**:
1. Create brief internal summary (not full template)
2. Log as activity in HubSpot with "Internal Note" or "Log activity" type
3. Include: Key learnings, deal readiness assessment, next steps
4. CC relevant team members (sales lead, account manager)
5. Mark as "Internal Use Only" if using external tool

### Case: Multi-Deal Meeting
**Situation**: One meeting covers multiple deals or prospects

**Process**:
- Create separate recap for each deal
- Customize to focus on that deal's discussion
- Reference cross-deal context if relevant (e.g., "We also discussed their other initiative around [Topic]")
- Log each recap in its respective deal record
