## 1. Executive Summary

{{executive_summary}}

> **BDR Instructions:** Write 2-3 paragraphs that:
> 1. Describe the client's current growth phase and website maturity
> 2. Identify the gap between where they are and where they need to be
> 3. Position this engagement as a strategic partnership, not just a vendor relationship
>
> Key themes to weave in (pull from meeting notes):
> - Client is moving from "validation" to "growth" phase
> - Current site lacks depth/structure/conversion optimization
> - Client needs a strategic partner, not just a Webflow vendor
> - Enablement — client should own the platform long-term
>
> Close with a summary of what this engagement delivers (4-5 bullets):
> - Expand and structure key pages
> - Improve clarity around value propositions
> - Increase conversion and lead volume over time
> - Establish a scalable Webflow foundation the client can manage in-house

## Terms & Conditions

**Assumptions:** {{agency_name}} is of the assumption that the Client has the capacity to provide all information and data that is reasonably required for {{agency_name}} to complete the delivery of the project.

**Communication & Collaboration:** All project communication will be conducted via Slack (or a {{agency_name}}-designated messaging platform), and all meetings will be held via Google Meet (or a {{agency_name}}-designated video conferencing tool). The Client agrees to join and actively participate in these platforms for the duration of the engagement. {{agency_name}} is unable to accommodate alternative communication or meeting platforms, including but not limited to Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or email-based project threads. This policy exists to ensure streamlined collaboration, centralized project records, and consistent response times across all stakeholders.

**Subscription Payments:** This scope of work constitutes a monthly subscription agreement between Client and {{agency_name}}. {{agency_name}} uses Capchase Pay as a Vendor for accepting monthly payments from its Clients. Payments made by Capchase to {{agency_name}} on Client's behalf will be considered payments made by the Client. The Client agrees to submit payment details through Capchase's designated payment link prior to the due date of the first payment.

**Confidentiality:** In view of the fact that Agency's work will bring Agency into close contact with many confidential affairs of Client not readily available to the public, and plans for future developments, Agency agrees to keep secret all matters, except for the existence of this engagement generally, and further agrees not to disclose any such matters to anyone outside of Agency throughout the term of this agreement, without written consent from Client.

**Intellectual Property:** Upon successful completion and launch of the website, all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, designs, code, and related content created specifically for this project, will be transferred to the Client. Any pre-existing intellectual property owned by {{agency_name}} or third parties used in the project will remain the property of the respective owner(s).

**Revisions:** During the design phase, clients are entitled to two (2) rounds of revisions per page template. Once a page has been fully developed according to the approved design, no further design changes will be made during the development phase. Any additional design modifications will require a formal change order at US${{hourly_rate}}/hour.

**Late Payments:** For all fees not received on or before the due date, interest will accrue at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding amount per month, or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. {{agency_name}} shall have the right to suspend all Services if any payment goes unpaid and reserves the right to submit any balance to collections.

**Shadow Care™:** Our guarantee to you, if you are not happy with the services provided and we did not meet your requirements as initially outlined by the second approval stage, we will give you 100% of your money back.

**Master Services Agreement:** By signing this SOW, you agree to our Master Services Agreement, located at {{msa_url}}, and to the deliverables, payment schedule, and terms listed above.
