# Example Input — Call Transcript

Hey Jordan, just got off a call with Hiya. Here's what happened:

Met with Sarah Chen (VP Marketing) and David Park (Head of Web). About 45 minutes. 

They're frustrated with their current Webflow setup — it was built by a freelancer two years ago and it's falling apart. Pages load slow, the CMS is a mess, and their SEO team is complaining that the site structure is killing their rankings. Sarah mentioned they just lost 15% of organic traffic in the last quarter and her CEO is breathing down her neck about it.

David asked a lot of questions about our AEO approach — he's been reading about answer engine optimization and is worried they're completely invisible to ChatGPT and Perplexity. I walked them through the AI brand report we generated for them (they scored 58/100) and Sarah said "that's embarrassing."

Budget-wise, Sarah said they have a "digital transformation" budget approved for Q2 but wouldn't give a specific number. When I mentioned our typical enterprise engagements start at $200K, she didn't flinch — which is a good sign. David mentioned they're also talking to a "big consultancy" but didn't name names.

Next steps: they want a proposal. Sarah asked if we could have something to her by end of next week. I told her we'd send a scoping document first to make sure we're aligned on requirements before the full proposal. She agreed.

David is going to send over their current site analytics and a list of their top 20 pages so we can do a proper technical assessment before scoping.

Overall feeling: this is a real deal. Sarah has budget authority and urgency. David is the champion internally. Main risk is the unnamed consultancy competitor.
