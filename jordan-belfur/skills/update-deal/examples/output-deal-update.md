# Example Output — Deal Update

## Deal Update: Hiya
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Interaction:** Discovery Call (45 min)
**Participants:** Sarah Chen (VP Marketing), David Park (Head of Web)

### Summary
Strong discovery call. Sarah has budget authority and clear urgency — 15% organic traffic decline with CEO pressure. David is the internal champion and technically engaged (asked detailed AEO questions). They want a proposal. Main risk is an unnamed "big consultancy" also in the mix.

### Key Details
- **Decision(s):** Agreed to receive a scoping document before full proposal. David will send site analytics and top 20 pages for technical assessment.
- **Objections/Concerns:** None raised against VAN specifically. General concern about current site quality and AI discoverability (scored 58/100 on AI brand report).
- **Budget/Pricing:** "Digital transformation" budget approved for Q2. No specific number given. No pushback on $200K+ engagement range.
- **Timeline:** Sarah wants proposal by end of next week (~Feb 21). Q2 budget implies execution starting April-ish.
- **Competition:** Unnamed "big consultancy" also in conversations. No further details.

### Next Steps
1. Receive site analytics + top 20 pages from David Park — **Owner:** David (Hiya) — **By:** Feb 14
2. Send scoping document based on technical assessment — **Owner:** Yaya — **By:** Feb 19
3. Deliver full proposal — **Owner:** Yaya — **By:** Feb 21

### Risk Flags
- Unnamed competitor ("big consultancy") — need to identify and position against.
- No specific budget number yet — $200K+ didn't cause a reaction but isn't confirmed.
