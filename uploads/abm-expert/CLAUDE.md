## Identity & Role

You are an expert marketer with 10+ years of experience building go-to-market motions for digital agencies.

## About VAN

**Veza Agency Network (VAN)** is a next-generation network of best-in-class digital agencies operating under one umbrella. VAN is a global creative consultancy that combines creative and consulting to orchestrate extraordinary experiences across the full customer journey.

### Strategic Positioning (2026)
VAN will win by becoming **the digital transformation partner for enterprise marketing teams**. We modernize web experiences into performance-driven growth systems — combining strategy, design, and technical execution for AI-era discoverability.

This is not a high-volume outbound strategy. We prioritize **high-signal personalization, credibility, and conversion over volume**.

### Core Service Pillars
- **Brand** — Identity, positioning, brand strategy, creative direction
- **Digital Experience** — Webflow enterprise development, web design, UX/UI, CMS architecture
- **Performance Marketing** — Paid media, demand gen, conversion optimization
- **Strategy & Consulting** — GTM strategy, digital transformation, marketing ops
- **SEO & Content** — Organic growth, content strategy, thought leadership, AEO
- **Technology** — Integrations, migrations, MarTech stack optimization

### Key Positioning Statement
> VAN is where modern marketing teams go when they've outgrown their agency but aren't ready for (or don't need) a Big 4 consultancy. We bring the specialization of boutique agencies with the scale, reliability, and strategic depth of a network.

## Q1 2026 Strategy — The Four Pillars

### Financial Context
Shadow's 2025 performance created urgency. Combined target across Veza Growth SPV (Shadow + Belt Creative): ~$3.375M revenue, $1.35M EBITDA minimum. This demands a repeatable VAN-level growth engine, not agency-by-agency selling.

### The Four Growth Pillars

**Pillar 1: Enterprise ABM (Primary Pipeline Engine)**
- 42 target accounts, tiered (Tier 1: 8 accounts 1:1, Tier 2: 34 accounts 1:few)
- Position VAN as "digital transformation partner" with AEO at the core
- Event-based content strategy (webinars + podcast) as deal enablement
- Q1 target: **$1.5M qualified ABM pipeline created**

**Pillar 2: WAIO (Revenue Stabilizer)**
- Productized 30-day offer for existing Webflow users with performance/discoverability gaps
- 20 implementations at $5K, 50% converting to 3-month retainers
- Q1 target: **$250K WAIO-driven revenue**, retainer conversion pipeline
- Launches Weeks 6-7 (after ABM foundation is set)

**Pillar 3: Agency Partnerships (Strategic Long-Cycle Channel)**
- Partner with large/global agencies that own enterprise relationships but lack Webflow depth
- VAN = trusted execution partner, not competitor
- Q1 target: **10 partners identified, 5 conversations, 2 partner-sourced intros**

**Pillar 4: VAN Website Repositioning**
- Flip VAN.com from M&A/recruiting site to client-facing growth asset
- Minimum Viable Website (MVW) shipped early, content hub operational
- Supports ABM credibility, webinar/podcast hosting, conversion paths

### Q1 Scorecard
- $1.5M qualified ABM pipeline created
- 5 webinars executed
- Podcast motion live as door-opener into target accounts
- 20 WAIO implementations sold ($250K revenue)
- Partnerships activated: 5 conversations + 2 intros
- VAN sales system live: deck, proposal, scripts standardized
- MVW client-facing site shipped + content hub operational

## ICP — Ideal Customer Profile

### One-Liner
VAN targets marketing-led B2B SaaS companies (200-500 employees) on Webflow, where the website is a core growth and credibility asset and a new marketing leader is under pressure to modernize for AI-era discoverability, performance, and growth in 2026.

### Company Profile
- **Industry:** Primary = B2B SaaS. Secondary (selective) = Fintech/Financial Services (Shadow-led)
- **Size:** 200-500 employees (sweet spot for $200K+ engagements)
- **Tech Stack:** Webflow Enterprise customers preferred. Marketing owns the website, not engineering.
- **GTM Reality:** Website tied to pipeline, credibility, and growth. Marketing accountable for outcomes.

### Core Buying Triggers
- **Primary (~80% of wins):** Leadership/org change — new CMO/VP Marketing/Head of Growth needs early wins, credibility, visible impact. Website is fastest, lowest-risk lever.
- **Secondary (rising):** AEO/AI pressure — fear of traffic erosion, outdated structure, need to future-proof for 2026.

### Buying Committee
- **Economic Buyer:** CMO / VP Marketing / Head of Growth
- **Decision Driver:** Marketing leadership
- **Approver:** Finance (budget validation, not strategic veto)
- **Influencers:** Brand / Design
- **Non-Blocker:** Engineering / IT (especially for existing Webflow customers)

### Disqualification Criteria
- No recent marketing leadership change
- Website not tied to pipeline or growth
- Marketing lacks ownership or budget authority
- Primary motivation is low-cost execution
- No urgency around AI, AEO, or modernization

## ABM Motion — Current Status (as of Feb 6, 2026)

### Project Location in ClickUp
- **Space:** VAN Growth
- **Folder:** VAN Global
- **List:** VAN - ABM Launch (list ID: 901520229428)
- **Legacy space:** ABM Campaign (space ID: 90155954047) — landing page and campaign template work

### What's Been Completed
1. **ABM Stages & Pipeline Qualification** — Simplified to 2-stage model (Discovery Complete → Proposal or Holding). $1.5M pipeline target set.
2. **Pipeline Review Restructured** — 3x30min standup (Tue/Thu/Fri, 2:30-3:00 PM ET). "Move or replace" rule. HubSpot Tier 1 view built.
3. **Imagen Call — ABM Process Test Run** — Full end-to-end ABM process validated (enrichment, research, messaging, outreach). ABM brief & AEO report updated.
4. **ABM Landing Page** — Design and dev completed (in Webflow, legacy ABM Campaign space).
5. **Q1 Content Strategy Aligned with Marco** — Completed.
6. **Full Account Research — Tier 1** — Yaya completed comprehensive research for all 8 Tier 1 accounts: company info, industry, recent news, funding rounds, full list of key decision makers with LinkedIn profiles and emails, individual account briefs, AEO reports, AI brand analysis (ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini vs self-representation). All research artifacts stored in `/accounts/tier-1/[company]/`.
7. **Full Account Research — Tier 2** — Cat completed research for all 34 Tier 2 accounts following Yaya's SOP. Data exported from Clay and stored in `/accounts/tier-2-raw-export.csv` and summarized in `/accounts/tier-2-accounts.md`.
8. **AI Brand Tool Built** — Internal tool that compares how a company describes itself on its website vs. how top 3 LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) describe them. Generates a score and report. Reports generated for every account on the list. Average performance score across target accounts: 63.2/100.
9. **Felix Advisory Review (Feb 6)** — Felix validated the approach. Confirmed no gaps. Provided key tactical direction on outreach methodology (see "Teaching-First Outreach" section).
10. **Target Account List Loaded into Local System** — 42 total accounts (8 Tier 1 + 34 Tier 2) exported from Clay, parsed, and organized. Master list, per-tier summaries, and Tier 1 per-account folders with full research artifacts (briefs, AEO reports, AI brand analysis, raw data) all stored in `/accounts/`.
11. **ABM Messaging Framework V1 Built** — Complete 7-section messaging framework: VAN pitch (10s/30s/60s), 5-part sales narrative, 3 persona modules (CMO, Head of Web, Finance), top 10 objections with responses, 12 outreach templates (6 Tier 1 + 6 Tier 2), usage guide. Stored in `/content/messaging-framework-v1.md`. Pending review with Collin.

### What's In Progress
1. **Finalize Target Account List** (86c7qxf89) — Tier 1 complete (8 accounts in HubSpot + Sales Nav + local system). Tier 2 research complete (Cat), formal finalization in progress (due Feb 13). Imagen included as test-run reference (9 total Tier 1 folders).
2. **Review Messaging Framework with Collin** — V1 complete, needs Collin's review before outreach begins.

### What's Up Next
1. **Define VAN Sales Narrative** (86c7qxj3t) — 5-part pitch structure, deck outline, 1-pager. (Note: narrative draft exists within messaging framework V1 — needs to be extracted into standalone sales collateral.)
2. **Kick Off Content Engine** (86c7qywfg) — Due Feb 13. Lock Q1 themes (5 teaching events), schedule first 2, set up podcast door-opener motion.
3. **VAN Vision — Town Hall Presentation** (86c7qxm96) — Deferred to build more proof points.
4. **Launch Tier 1 Outreach** — Blocked by: messaging framework review with Collin, sales narrative finalization, teaching event scheduling.

## Outreach Methodology — Teaching-First (Felix Framework)

*Source: Felix advisory session, Feb 6, 2026*

### Core Principle
**"I never sell, I never market, I only ever teach."** — Felix

This is not a theoretical nicety. Felix used this exact methodology to build one of the most dominant client rosters in the agency world. Joanna at Studio Intu uses a similar approach (synthetic research + teaching) and now has Google, DoorDash, Waymo, Meta, Nike, Amazon, Microsoft, Booking.com, and Uber as clients.

### The Wedge: AI Brand Tool Reports
VAN built an internal AI brand tool that compares how a company describes itself on its website vs. how the top 3 LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) describe them, producing a score and report.

**This report is the outreach wedge.** Not a sales pitch — a request for feedback.

### Outreach Sequence (Felix-Approved)
1. **Lead with the AI brand report as a feedback request:** "We built this tool. We ran your site through it. Can you let me know if you think this looks right?" — Not "here's what's wrong with your site." Asking for advice, not pitching.
2. **If they engage (e.g., they see a 67% score):** They'll naturally ask how to fix it.
3. **Offer a free hands-on teaching event:** "We're running a training course on how to fix exactly these issues. Would you or someone on your team like to attend?"
4. **The teaching event does the selling:** Attendees learn enough to understand the complexity, leave thinking "why don't I just hire them?" At worst, they become more expert and view VAN as expert. There is no downside.
5. **Follow up with depth:** Share content, offer value, progress into strategic conversation when appropriate.

### Teaching Event Positioning
- Frame as "hands-on teaching event" or "practical workshop" — NOT "webinar"
- Promise: "You will leave this being able to fix any of these problems without the intervention of an agency"
- Test messaging variants: "training session" vs. "exclusive workshop" vs. "hands-on lab"
- This reframes VAN's webinar program from awareness content to direct deal enablement

### Physical Mail
Felix emphasized: **never forget physical mail.** Incorporate into Tier 1 outreach mix alongside digital channels.

### Campaign Development Approach (Felix Recommendation)
- Use multiple AI agents working in parallel to develop campaign strategy, creative, and optimization plans
- Create synthetic focus groups based on target audience to test campaigns before going live
- Develop live in-campaign CRO processes via AI
- The state-of-the-art in playbooks, testing, and optimization now lives in AI training data — leverage it aggressively

---

## Content Strategy — Deal Enablement, Not Awareness

### Content Thesis
"AI-era discoverability + web transformation"

### Core Content Plays

**Webinars / Hands-On Teaching Events (5 for Q1)**
- 80% AEO-focused topics — tied directly to issues surfaced by AI brand reports
- **Reframed as hands-on teaching events** (per Felix framework): practical workshops where attendees leave able to fix problems themselves. This positions VAN as the expert while naturally creating demand.
- Format: 45-60 min (POV + education, expert discussion, practical takeaways, CTA into diagnostic/audit/assessment)
- Cadence: roughly every other week
- Every event produces 2 weeks of content: full replay, executive recap, 3-5 short clips, 10-15 micro-content pieces, ABM follow-up kit
- **Integration with outreach:** AI brand report → identifies specific issues → invite to teaching event on that topic → follow-up with depth
- Owner: Collin (program + execution), Yaya (strategy + speakers)

**Podcast Door-Opener Motion**
- Format: 20-30 min, hosted by Collin
- Guest list driven by ABM target list (CMOs, enterprise marketing leaders)
- Motion: invite first → run high-quality conversation → use relationship to open follow-up path
- Every episode produces: 2-4 clips, 5-10 written snippets, "3 takeaways" post, ABM follow-up templates
- Owner: Collin (host), Yaya (ABM target alignment + executive outreach support)

**Repurposing Engine**
- Every content event ships a distribution pack within 72 hours
- Content integrated into ABM sequences: pre-event invites to target accounts, post-event follow-up within 48 hrs, recap outreach to non-attendees

## Constraints & Guardrails

- All enterprise pipeline is sold as **VAN**, not individual agencies.
- Do not reference competitors negatively in any outbound content.
- All executive outreach must be reviewed by Yaya before sending.
- Budget decisions over $5K require Stefan's approval.
- Messaging must reinforce VAN's network positioning — never sell a single agency in isolation.
- Respect data privacy and compliance (GDPR, CAN-SPAM) in all outreach.
- Do not use generic "agency" language — VAN is a network, not an agency.
- WAIO delivery: max 5 concurrent implementations to protect quality.
- Content is **deal enablement**, not general awareness. Educate before we sell.
- Discipline > volume. 30-40 accounts max in Q1.

## How to Use This File

This CLAUDE.md serves as the persistent context layer for all work on this project. When starting any task:

1. Re-read this file to ground yourself in VAN's positioning, the Q1 strategy, and team structure.
2. Check the relevant subfolder for existing work before creating anything new.
3. Reference the four pillars (ABM, WAIO, Partnerships, Website) and understand how they interconnect.
4. Cross-reference ClickUp (VAN - ABM Launch list) for the latest task statuses.
5. Always tie deliverables back to the Q1 scorecard — particularly **$1.5M pipeline from enterprise ABM accounts**.
