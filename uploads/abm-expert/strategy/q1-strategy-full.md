# **VAN Growth 2026 Q1 Strategy Memo**

# Executive Summary

VAN is entering a pivotal growth phase. While revenue is stabilizing, Shadow’s 2025 performance has created a position where we need to deliver meaningful results quickly. In combination with Belt Creative, our target is \~$3.375M in revenue and at least $1.35M of EBITDA across Veza Growth SPV.

**This creates urgency to establish a repeatable VAN-level growth engine** rather than relying on agency-by-agency selling. Historically, agencies across the platform have been overly dependent on referrals and word of mouth.

**Over the next 90 days, our primary objective is pipeline creation.** The goal is to launch a unified go-to-market motion that generates a measurable enterprise pipeline for VAN while stabilizing near-term revenue and building the infrastructure required for consistent execution over the next 3–12 months.

**Our core growth engine will be an Enterprise ABM motion** focused on a targeted list of \~30–40 enterprise accounts. This motion will position VAN as a “digital transformation” partner. With AEO at the core, we will also be combining design, development, migrations, and content.

**The primary driver behind this ABM motion will be an event-based content strategy** (webinars and podcast programming) designed to build trust, create executive-level conversations, and progress target accounts through the funnel. The principle is to educate before we sell.

Two supporting growth motions will run in parallel. First, a WAIO Lite implementation offer targeted toward existing Webflow users will drive near-term revenue via quick wins: 20 implementations at $5K with a target of 50% converting into retainers for a minimum 3-month engagement, generating \~$250K total revenue. Second, agency partnership development will be maintained as a strategic long-cycle channel to unlock enterprise introductions through global agency relationships.

Success in the first 90 days will be measured through leading indicators rather than closed revenue: $1.5M in qualified ABM pipeline created, along with WAIO conversion metrics, meetings booked, and account progression against weekly execution KPIs.

# Strategy

**VAN will win by becoming the digital transformation partner for enterprise marketing teams.** We will modernize web experiences into performance-driven growth systems — combining strategy, design, and technical execution for AI-era discoverability.

We will accomplish this through an enterprise ABM motion targeting \~30–40 accounts, supported by (1) a productized WAIO offer to stabilize near-term revenue and convert into retainers, and (2) strategic agency partnerships to unlock long-cycle enterprise pipeline.

This is not a high-volume outbound strategy. We are not pursuing “spray-and-pray” outreach, mass email automation, or low-quality content production. Our strategy prioritizes high-signal personalization, credibility, and conversion over volume.

We will win by delivering hyper-personalized insights and assets that create executive trust and drive conversion. This includes:

* Hand-picked target accounts with tiered ABM personalization (1:1 and 1:few)

* Coordinated multi-channel outreach across LinkedIn, email, and targeted advertising

* Role-specific messaging across the buying committee (marketing, finance, and operations)

* Event-based content (webinars \+ podcast) built as deal enablement infrastructure, not general awareness

* A long-term “door opener” roadmap, including physical mail and executive dinners

We are targeting enterprise marketing teams where the website is a critical growth and credibility channel, and where modernization is urgent due to performance bottlenecks and AI-era discoverability shifts.

The first 90 days will focus on pipeline generation and operational repeatability. This is not a one-time campaign; it is the foundation of VAN’s go-to-market motion. In Q1, our success will be measured primarily by pipeline creation: **$1.5M in qualified ABM pipeline generated** from enterprise accounts, alongside WAIO volume and conversion into retainer engagements.

Launch the minimum pages required for Q1 pipeline support:

* Homepage (client-facing positioning \+ proof \+ CTA)  
* Services overview page (what VAN offers at a high level)  
* Proof page (case studies / outcomes / credibility)  
* Content hub:  
  * webinar landing pages \+ replays  
  * podcast landing page \+ episodes  
* Contact / CTA page (book call)

Maintain:

* Join VAN / Vision page (agency recruiting) as a single page, separated from client-facing flow

**Owner:** Collin (execution) \+ Yannick (prioritization \+ approvals)  
**Output:** site supports ABM credibility and conversion immediately

---

## **Step 3 — Integrate Website into ABM \+ Content Motion (Weeks 3–12)**

### **Deliverables**

* Every webinar has:  
  * registration page  
  * replay page  
  * recap post  
* Every podcast has:  
  * episode page  
  * clips \+ takeaways embedded into the content hub  
* ABM sequences drive to specific pages (not generic homepage)  
* Retargeting ads drive traffic to content \+ proof pages

**Owner:** Collin \+ Yannick  
**Output:** website becomes the “trust library” powering outbound and deal enablement

---

## **Step 4 — Full Repositioning Build (Weeks 5–12)**

### **Deliverables**

* Refine information architecture (client-first sitemap)  
* Add supporting pages based on ABM learnings:  
  * vertical pages (optional)  
  * offer detail pages (enterprise transformation, WAIO, support)  
  * FAQs to reduce friction (security, process, delivery model)  
* Improve conversion paths:  
  * clearer CTA routing  
  * stronger proof placement  
  * faster access to relevant content

**Owner:** Collin (delivery) \+ Yannick (direction)  
**Output:** VAN.com becomes a scalable, client-facing lead generation \+ conversion asset

---

## **Q1 Success Criteria (Website Repositioning)**

* MVW shipped and live within Q1 (early, not late)  
* VAN.com clearly positioned as client-facing (platform, not agency)  
* Content hub operational:  
  * webinar replays \+ recaps  
  * podcast archive  
* Website supports pipeline creation:  
  * measurable CTA conversions from ABM traffic  
  * improved conversion via proof \+ content

---

### **Note**

Website work will run in two speeds to avoid blocking growth:

* **Fast ship:** Minimum Viable Website to support ABM immediately  
* **Parallel build:** deeper repositioning over Q1 based on real market feedback

# VAN Sales System

# **VAN Sales System (Platform Selling \+ Conversion Engine)**

### **Objective**

Create a unified VAN-first sales process that enables consistent enterprise conversion from ABM pipeline. This includes standardizing how we pitch, qualify, propose, and close—so deals are sold as **VAN** (not individual agencies) while remaining repeatable across founders and future sales hires.

### **What we will deliver in Q1**

* A standardized VAN-first discovery \+ qualification process (reusable across all agencies)  
* Core VAN-branded sales collateral (deck, one-pager, proposal template, proof pack)  
* A consistent post-meeting workflow (next steps, follow-ups, proposal turnaround)  
* A rollout plan to transition founder-led selling into a scalable sales organization

---

## **Step 1 — Define VAN Sales Narrative \+ Positioning (Weeks 1–2)**

### **Deliverables**

* VAN “Sales Narrative” (standard pitch structure):  
  * who VAN is  
  * what we do  
  * why now (AI-era discoverability \+ modernization)  
  * proof points  
  * how engagements work  
* Persona framing for buying committee:  
  * CMO / VP Marketing  
  * Head of Web / Digital  
  * Finance / Procurement  
* Core objection handling (top 10 objections)

**Owner:** CGO \+ Collin \+ Marketing lead  
**Output:** a single VAN pitch that all sellers can deliver consistently

---

## **Step 2 — Standardize Discovery \+ Qualification Process (Weeks 2–3)**

### **Deliverables**

* Standard discovery call agenda (45–60 min)  
* Qualification framework (simple \+ consistent):  
  * need / urgency  
  * complexity  
  * buying committee  
  * budget alignment  
* Call scripts:  
  * discovery call script  
  * second call / solution call script  
* Success criteria for “what qualifies as pipeline”  
* Standard next-step flow:  
  * recap email template  
  * timeline \+ stakeholder mapping  
  * proposal expectation setting

**Owner:** CGO \+ AE (or acting seller)  
**Output:** repeatable call flow that increases conversion and reduces deal chaos

---

## **Step 3 — Build VAN-Branded Sales Collateral (Weeks 2–4)**

### **Deliverables**

* VAN core deck (10–12 slides)  
* VAN one-pager (quick overview)  
* VAN proposal template (modular by offer type)  
* Proof pack:  
  * 3–5 best case studies (enterprise-friendly)  
  * key outcomes (speed, conversion, delivery velocity, AI discoverability)  
* “Ways We Help” service overview sheet (high-level packages)

**Owner:** Marketing lead \+ CGO  
**Output:** sellers can pitch and propose as VAN with a premium, consistent look and story

---

## **Step 4 — Implement VAN-First Selling Model Across Agencies (Weeks 4–6)**

### **Deliverables**

* Clear rules of engagement (VAN-first):  
  * how sellers introduce VAN vs agencies  
  * how delivery pods are positioned (behind the scenes)  
  * what offers we lead with (ABM enterprise \+ WAIO)  
* Rollout plan:  
  * how founders adopt the pitch \+ collateral  
  * who sells what in Q1 while AE/SDR ramp  
* Simple interim deal routing \+ crediting rule:  
  * “If sourced through VAN ABM, it’s a VAN deal”

**Owner:** CGO \+ Collin \+ agency founders  
**Output:** alignment \+ adoption, eliminating fragmented selling

---

## **Step 5 — Create a Repeatable Proposal \+ Closing Motion (Weeks 5–8)**

### **Deliverables**

* Proposal turnaround SLAs (e.g., \<72 hours after solution call)  
* Proposal structure (modular blocks):  
  * problem framing  
  * approach \+ timeline  
  * investment / pricing  
  * proof points  
  * terms \+ next steps  
* Close motion:  
  * procurement workflow  
  * “decision meeting” agenda template  
  * follow-up cadence templates

**Owner:** CGO \+ AE \+ Ops/Delivery lead  
**Output:** faster cycles, higher close rate, cleaner handoff to delivery

---

## **Step 6 — Sales Enablement \+ Adoption Loop (Weeks 6–12)**

### **Deliverables**

* Founder training session (selling as VAN)  
* Weekly conversion retro:  
  * what objections are showing up  
  * where we’re losing deals  
  * which assets/scripts need iteration  
* Versioned playbook:  
  * v1 by end of Q1  
  * v2 in Q2 based on real pipeline learnings

**Owner:** CGO \+ Collin  
**Output:** continuous improvement \+ institutional knowledge (not founder memory)

---

# **Q1 Success Criteria (VAN Sales System)**

* All enterprise pipeline is sold as **VAN**, not individual agencies  
* Core VAN collateral complete:  
  * deck \+ one-pager \+ proposal template \+ proof pack  
* Standard discovery \+ qualification process adopted across sellers  
* Proposal turnaround time reduced and consistent (target: \<72 hours)  
* Measurable conversion improvements (meeting → opp creation → pipeline)

---

### **Note**

The VAN sales system will be rolled out in two speeds:

* **Minimum Viable Sales System (Weeks 1–3):** enough to sell immediately  
* **Standardization \+ adoption (Weeks 4–12):** training, iteration, scalability
