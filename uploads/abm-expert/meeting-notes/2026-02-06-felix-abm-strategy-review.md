Summary

### ABM Strategy Progress

**Thinking about the current state of the ABM implementation**

Yaya and Colin provided an update on their ABM strategy implementation over the past two weeks: 

- Established their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Compiled a list of approximately 40 target accounts, tiered into tier one and tier two categories
- Completed comprehensive research for all tier one accounts (Yaya conducted this research directly)
- Kat completed research for tier two accounts following an SOP

**Research deliverables for each account include:**

- Company information, industry details, recent news, and funding rounds
- Complete list of key decision makers with LinkedIn profiles and emails
- Individual account briefs

**New AI brand tool developed:**

- Built internally to address the gap between technical SEO audits and marketer needs
- Compares how companies describe themselves on their website versus how top three LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini) describe them
- Generates a score and report for each account

### Felix's Key Advice on Execution

**Finding action items and strategic direction**

Felix recommended a fundamentally different approach to campaign development and testing:  

- **Leverage AI agents instead of traditional consulting**: Use multiple GPTs working together to develop campaign strategy, creative, and optimization plans
- **Create synthetic focus groups**: Build synthetic populations based on target audience to test campaigns in real time or accelerated time
- **Develop live CRO processes**: Have AI create in-campaign conversion rate optimization processes

Felix noted that AI now has access to world-class playbooks that are "researched thoroughly tested, documented, written about, peer-reviewed, bench-tested" - more comprehensive than any individual consultant's knowledge  

### Teaching-First Outreach Strategy

**Developing the approach for account engagement**

The team discussed positioning their AI brand tool as a teaching opportunity rather than a sales pitch:

- Reach out with the AI brand report by asking for feedback: "We built this tool, ran your site through it - can you let me know if you think this looks right?"
- **Never forget physical mail** as a channel
- Apply the principle: "If you want money, ask for advice. If you ask for money, you'll get advice"

**Felix's teaching methodology:**

- His approach: "I never sell, I never market, I only ever teach" through books and teaching events
- Hands-on teaching events position the agency as experts while helping prospects realize the complexity of execution
- This approach powered his agency success, winning major clients

**Proposed outreach approach:**

- Offer free hands-on training courses or webinars on fixing specific issues identified in the AI brand reports
- Position as practical workshops where attendees "will leave being able to fix any of these problems" without agency intervention
- Test different messaging: training session, exclusive workshop, etc.

### AI Tools and Technology Discussion

**Understanding the AI tools landscape**

Felix shared insights from building [multibookagents.net](http://multibookagents.net) in 24 hours using AI agents: 

- Used agents to set up application, e-commerce, Stripe integration, and promotional campaigns
- Set up LinkedIn, Twitter (failed due to policy issues), Google Ads, and MailChimp abandoned cart programs via APIs
- Using ClaudeBots for UX testing with browser control capabilities

**Tool recommendations:**

- **Clot Code** preferred over Clot Cowork - more powerful and always one step ahead, despite less polished interface
- Opus 4.6 now has marketing plugin as of yesterday with parallel agent capabilities
- Felix's agent "Felix five underscore agent" can run live in-browser testing

**Current Felix V5 project:**

Investigating governance and verification systems for AI-human interaction spaces, including verification of messaging and identity

And Colin dropped off earlier.

Can you all hear me?

Yeah, you're good on my end, Colin.

Okay.

Yeah, you're coming through loud and clear for me, Yannick.

Perfect. So we have an independent third party. Felix might be on your end then. Yeah. Happy Friday, brother. How you doing?

Happy Friday. I'm doing good.

I'm kind of coming down to the wire on some of these proposals. Yeah.

I've got a proposal review call with a client at 1230 and I'm like halfway through doing the proposal.

If you can see me, I'm going to restart my machine.

So I keep trying to log back in. Thanks, man. Yeah.

How's your week going? I know that you said there's a lot going on on the M&A side of things.

Yeah, man. Trying to just get that third side of deal over the finish line. Guys, can you hear me? Yeah, we can hear you.

Make an area. I'm guessing you can't hear us.

Yeah.

I think he's got some internet issues going on.

Guys, I'm going to restart everything. I'll be three minutes. Okay. You said Dorsata, they've been kind of like dragging across.

into a dock and then you plug everything into the dock. Got it. Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh good. Oh hey. We're coming through. We've got video. I think we're working. Nice and clear.

It seems to be mine. You are both chopping. I don't understand why you're both being choppy. My speed test says I have 600 megabits going on. You're very clear now on my end.

Yeah, all good for me.

We'll go to 5G and see whether that makes a difference. Okay. Colin, I was trying to find, I don't know if you've ever watched this, but in these situations, I always think of daddy daycare. you where she's on the phone. She's talking to China or whatever. Remember that? She's like, can you hear me now?

Years since I've watched that movie. I think you just like unlocked a core memory. Yeah. Now I'm thinking about it. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Does Eddie Murphy still make movies? I don't think I've seen anything from him in a long time.

He's done a couple of those weird funny horror movie kind of things, but... I don't think anything. I think that guy is set for life.

He's just coasting. Yeah. He probably got his, got his check and he's done. Yeah. I can't blame him.

Probably getting royalties still too on everything. So that's how it goes. Right. All right, you're moving clearly, but you're on mute, Felix. Sorry about the technology.

All good. All good. Is it a Friday if it doesn't cooperate?

If it happens again... Does one of you want to call me on Slack and I'll pick up on my mobile and we'll try with that? Perfect, sure, we can do that. But this seems pretty clear now. Yeah. It does seem to be. Yeah. Let's see. So, right, what do you want? Yes, so first of all, Thought, excuses for not briefing you properly. It's kind of been a crazy M&A week. So I'd like to take kind of like the first five minutes to just get you up to speed and then would like your thoughts on a few things.

So as you know, over the past two weeks, Colin and I have been working on implementing our new ABM strategy. So we presented that strategy deck. That's the one that you saw as well to the rest of the team, got buy-in and started working on that. accomplished now over the past couple of weeks is Number one, setting our ICP. Number two, we put together a list of 40-ish total accounts. We've tiered that out into tier one and tier two accounts.

For all tier one accounts where we thought that the signal was the highest and the fit was the best, and I can tell you why we believe that based on the data that we had put together, I did the research myself. For all tier two accounts, Kat just completed the research. based on an SOP that I had put together for her. So what we have now for tier one and tier two is the accounts list, information about the company itself, industry, recent news, funding rounds.

And we have a clear list of all key decision makers at each one of the companies. We have LinkedIn profiles, emails, Then we put all of that together into a brief. So we have a brief for each one of these different accounts. And then we also built a tool internally that's basically an AI brand tool. So we have the very technical AEO audit. But what Colin and I realized is the people that we're talking to are not very technical.

They're marketers. So what marketers care about is, one, do I show up in AEO? And if I do, then how? Build a tool that compares how they speak about themselves on their own website to how the top three LLMs talk about their company. So ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. Then our tool compares those against each other and gives them a score. So we have that report now for every single one of the accounts as well.

And that's where we stand. Now it's kind of like, okay, now we've kind of prepped everything. We sharpened our ax. Now I wanted to meet with you. about, okay, let's say we actually now... start executing, what are the next steps from here? Is it LinkedIn? Do we invite them to an event? Do we send emails? I'm kind of fuzzy. As you know, this is kind of my first time running an ABM process like this.

I feel like we've done a very good job of sharpening the ax. Now, before we actually start breaking down the tree, I wanted to check in with you. One, if you believe that everything we've done is kind of in the right direction, if there's any holes or gaps that you're seeing that we should fill first. cleared for takeoff. How do we take off? Okay.

And...

I mean, it's very interesting, right? I'm looking at this from the point of view of... Um, I want you to succeed. I'm not an ABM expert. I chaired the world's leading ABM agency. That doesn't mean I know anything about ABM other than broad brush, probably what you know. Right? But let me tell you what... And I started... Europe's first SEO company in 1996. Okay, cool.

So in theory, I should know about that too.

Um, It turns out that where I used to be a digital expert, I started the world's first DCRM agents. So I used to have some expertise. But yesterday or the day before yesterday in 24 hours, I built an application and an e-commerce setup and set up the Stripe and stuff and started promoting it. And I did that by asking agents to do it for me. Yeah, I saw your post about Clockbot. I've been playing and setting up mine all week and it's been absolutely just, it broke my brain and I want to have a completely separate conversation with you.

I wish I could have joined your session on Thursday, but I was just deep in some other stuff, but let's definitely talk about that. It's great. I mean, and I'm using it, interestingly, I know this is a digression. I'm using it, interestingly, to do UX testing on the app that it built by firing up browsers. Love that. Which none of the AIs can do themselves. Yeah. Yeah. Because I've given it control of my machine or part of my machine.

Anyway. The reason I mention it is because I've had it do the LinkedIn ad campaign set up, the Twitter ad campaign set up, although that has failed because Twitter is so fucking awful. Apparently I'm in violation of some of their policies and not allowed to advertise. Okay. I've also had it set up a Google Ads campaign and a... an abandoned cart program in MailChimp using APIs and so on and so on and so on.

Nice. The reason I've got it to do it is because I've got a rudimentary idea of how you sell shit, right? I've got a fairly good idea about what customer journeys are because... I understand customer journeys. backwards and forwards. in theory. What I don't understand is the state of the art. And what I don't have is the world's best playbook researched thoroughly tested, documented, written about, peer-reviewed, bench-tested, and blah, blah, blah.

So I don't know for the audience that you are trying to target. What the... chain of links and what parallel chains must be going on in order to effectively deliver an ABM campaign and re-optimize it as you're going along. But Opus 4.6 now has plugins, one of which is a marketing plugin. Yeah. As of yesterday. and does parallel agent. I've got coworker running parallel agents to deliver 20 different things all at the same time through a master agent.

Yeah. I've got one currently running in the background to do. I do as well. It's running right now. Yeah. That capability. is where you should be getting your, how do I do this? How do I test it? How do we optimize it as we go along the flow? not asking somebody who used to kind of know what he was doing. Right? And some of my expertise inevitably has been used in some of the training models. I know this came as a reminder of some of the training models, right?

Right. The multi-channel ecosystems book is in some of the training models. Doesn't mean that I'm the one to come to you. It means that whatever I used to know is part of a vastly bigger and more sophisticated field of knowledge that you should be tapping into. Got it. That makes sense. So my strong advice to you is, is don't ask me, Okay. Ask. three or four different GPTs. Yep. to work together to do it for you.

to come up with a rational testing plan. And probably to the point create a synthetic population based on your target audience and run the tests either in real time or in accelerated time to see what could possibly go wrong. and where optimizations may happen. Hmm. So I would go down the synthetic focus group root, Okay. Right. So get it to come up with a campaign. Getting to come up with the creative and all of the stuff.

Get it to come up with a CRO, a live in-campaign CRO process. and get it to come up with a synthetic focus group to test it on. Okay. And you'll have the answer tomorrow. Yeah. And honestly, that's what Colin and I have been doing. I mean, we've been leaning very heavily into this, um, And... you know, and maybe it's, um, nostalgic almost at this point that I wanted a human opinion on it. But yeah, I hear you a lot in clear and I think that I feel confident in what we've built so far.

So maybe as long as you don't really see any gaps in what I just said, something where like, oh, well, you did that wrong. I think then you're absolutely right. We'll keep the course with the way that we've been doing things up until this point. Okay. I mean, I would caution you never to forget physical mail. Yeah. Right. And the basic principles that, um, Okay, so there's an adage in investment circles.

If you want money, ask for advice. If you ask for money, you'll get advice. Okay. So The way that that translates into marketing for me, for agencies, I teach I never sell, I never market, I only ever teach. And I teach through writing books and I teach through putting on teaching events, how to do strategy maps, how to do growth lab teams, how to do whatever, right? I used to teach how to do ECRM strategy.

I used to teach how to do customer journey planning. Not because... necessarily I wanted everybody to come along and just take it and go, but I knew that if they came along, because they were gonna learn a new skill or something that was essential to their current need, they'd come along, they'd go away, they'd have written it down, they'd get back to the office and say, "Fuck, this looks difficult.

"Why don't I just fucking hire them?" Yeah, right. And that empowered... the last eight years of my agency leadership, my agency ownership career. I just taught. And we won every client you can think of. My client roster is, Not second to none anymore because Joellen now has a client roster that is better than mine was. But mine was... you know, top of the game. Yeah. All the little clients. Joanna at Studio Intu, who you may have met, Yaya, in the DAB group.

Joanna, she now has, Google, DoorDash, Waymo, Meta, Nike Amazon. Microsoft. Did I say Waymo? She's just won Booking.com. and she's onboarding with Uber. Wow.

Nice.

That's all of them. She's the agency.

Wow.

And she's using synthetic research to get... Got it. Okay.

That's encouraging.

You know what that makes me think, Colin? The way that we could reach out with the AI brand report is almost in a way where it's hey, we built this tool. We ran your site through it. Can you let me know if you think this looks right? And kind of just like, you know what I mean? Not even saying, hey, here's what's wrong with your site, but kind of just like, hey, we built this tool. We ran this, you know, this is how we built it.

This is how we're thinking about it. Would love your feedback on it. And then if they say that they have a 67% score, then, you know, then they might say, well, you know, yeah, that looks right. How do we fix it?

I'm inclined to agree. I think that also kind of increases the importance of our content marketing stuff as well. Like being able to reach out with like, hey, we've got this webinar coming up. Hey, we had this webinar with Webflow. Here are the top insights, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think we've known for some time now.

If you can do an audit and you can say, listen, we've ran your site through, listen, we've always wanted to work with you, right?

Yeah.

So we've got this new tool. We ran your site through it. and it turns out you need X, right? We are running a training course, a free training training course on how to fix X. Why don't you come along? Why don't you send one of your guys?

That's good, actually. Or just a free webinar on how to fix XYZ. That's actually pretty smart. I like that.

Yeah. We will teach you the way that we fix these things. Mm-hmm. Because the reality is, is what? At worst, they become more expert and they think that you're expert. Right. Right. Well, no. At worst, they know what you know already, right? Right, right. In which case, you're an expert because they're an expert. So there's no lose here. I like that. I like that a lot. Yeah. a completely different thing than, oh, we got a webinar coming up.

Hands-on teaching event. This is, our teachers are doing a hands-on teaching event, right? Teaching, learn, learn, learn, practical, you'll leave this being able to fix any of these problems. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Without the intervention of an agency.

We can test the messaging on that. It can be like a training session, exclusive workshop. We can kind of see what resonates with our audience.

See Felix, don't cut yourself short. You still got a couple tricks up your sleeve.

Yeah, that's why we came here today.

Yeah, I think I'm not necessarily selling myself short. What I'm trying to do is redirect. Yes, absolutely. Don't talk to me.

Don't redirect you, I'm asking the right questions. Totally, yeah. Just give us access to your cloud bot. Just put it in a Slack group with us and we'll just ask him.

At the moment it's investigating governance Um... and verification systems for AI human interaction Spaces. Okay. Interesting. So, so verification of messaging and identity and all of that kind of stuff.

Yeah. Right. If you're interested in that, go play.

My agent is called Felix five underscore agent. I love it, it's like, yeah. And listen, MaltBookAgents.net I need some customers. So if you know anybody who wants an agent, Right? Fire them to MaltBookAgents.net and they can buy themselves a turnkey done-for-you agent. Well, fuck. Okay. agents.netNice. Thanks. Yes, and I'm guessing Felix V5 built all of this, yeah? No, Felix Five... Felix Five agent And.

specified it Once I've created, I basically said, how would you create another version of you? I then got, I tried, I spent 24 hours trying to get chat GPT to build it and it failed repeatedly. I think I'm co-work involved and co-work built it. And then it was a collaboration between Claude Max, Co-work and Felix Five. Got it. And then Felix5, because none of the agents, none of the GPTs can do live in-browser testing, but my agent can.

So my open floor basically can, if you give it the right permissions, can open and then run browser sessions in Chrome. So I got it to do the UX evaluation. I'm just about to, after this, just about to launch V2 of this site.

Nice.

With slightly improved UX and some SEO and AIO baked into it now. Okay. Very cool. You can, by the way, run browser sessions. in Clot Code directly as well and have it take control of the browser. That's Clot Code. I've been using Clot Max and Clot Cowork. I haven't been able to browse the sessions in either of those. So check out Clot Code because the only difference between Clot Code and Clot Cowork is just that Cowork just has a prettier interface.

That's the only difference. But Clot Code is actually always one step ahead of it and a little bit more powerful. So if you're not afraid by kind of like the terminal look, then it gives you a little bit more. capabilities. Yeah, I've been in terminal setting up OpenCtrl anyway. Exactly. Yeah. Cool. All right. Awesome. There you go, guys. Appreciate it. Yes, it was.

Super helpful. Super helpful. Yes, it was. All right, guys. Thank you, sir. All right. Take care, everybody.
